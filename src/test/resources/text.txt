Sequencing of the recombinant plasmids and the PCR amplification products was performed according to Lata et al. (2010). Alignments were carried out by ClustalW with default parameters (Thompson et al., 1994). The phylogenetic tree for the SiDREB2 gene was built using the software program MEGA 4.0 based on protein sequences. The phylogenetic tree was set up with the distance matrix using the Neighborâ€“Joining (NJ) method with 1000 bootstrap replications. Secondary structure prediction of the SiDREB2 protein was performed using the program PSIPRED (Jones, 1999).
