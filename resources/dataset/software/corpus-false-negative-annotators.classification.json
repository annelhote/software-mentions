The global signal is thought to reflect a combination of physiological processes (ie cardiac and respiratory fluctuations), and therefore, it was included in the GLM to control for such factors. Correlation analysis was carried out between the seed ROIs and PFC in a voxel-wise manner using REST. The correlation coefficients were then transformed to Z-values using the Fisher r-to-z transformation. In the first-level analysis, a 1-sample t test model was used to delineate the functional connectivity of each amygdala ROI. In the second-level random effects analysis, direct comparisons were conducted to identify differences in functional connectivity between SZ vs HC, BD vs HC, and SZ vs BD. Statistical significance was determined by a corrected P < .05. Correction for multiple comparisons was made by combining individual voxel P < .005 with cluster size > 432mm 3 , determined by the Monte Carlo simulation (AlphaSim command line in AFNI [analysis of functional neuroimaging; Cox, 1996] 53 ). An additional Bonferroni correction (P = .005/P = .00056) was used as well, because a total of 9 two-sample t tests (SZ vs HC, BD vs HC, and SZ vs BD, multiplied by 3 ROIs) were performed. Exploratory analyses were performed to examine the correlation between the Z-values of regions showing significant group differences and symptom rating scores (the BPRS in the SZ group, and the HDRS and YMRS in the BD group).

Participants were instructed to rest with their eyes closed during scanning. No participant reported falling asleep during the scan when routinely asked immediately after scanning. FMRI data were collected using a gradient-echo planar imaging sequence sensitive to BOLD contrast (TR = 2000ms, TE = 30ms, Diverse Amygdala-Frontal Connectivity in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder flip angle = 90\u00b0, FOV = 24 \u00d7 24cm, matrix = 64 \u00d7 64). Thirty-five axial slices were collected with 3-mm thickness without gap. For spatial normalization and localization, a 3-dimensional fast spoiled gradient-echo T1-weighted sequence was used to acquire high-resolution structural images (TR = 7.1ms, TE = 3.2ms, FOV = 24 \u00d7 24cm, matrix = 240 \u00d7 240, slice thickness = 1.0mm without gap, 176 slices, 1 averages). Image preprocessing was carried out using SPM5 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) and Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit (REST) (http:// www.restfmri.net). Preprocessing using SPM5 consisted of slice-time correction, motion correction, spatial normalization, and spatial smoothing full width at half maximum (FWHM = 6mm). Movement parameters were examined for each participant. Data sets with more than 2mm maximum translation in x, y or z, or 2\u00b0 of maximum rotation about 3 axes between each image were excluded. Preprocessing using REST consisted of removing linear drift through linear regression and temporal band-pass filtering (0.01-0.08 Hz) to reduce the effects of lowfrequency drifts and physiological high-frequency noise."

Among these genes, EDN1, INHBA, TGF\u03b21, TGF\u03b22, RUNX1, LHX8, SNAI1, PDGFC, and PIGA were upregulated; while only SMAD3 was downregulated in response to TGF\u03b2treatment.

Affymetrix probe identifiers and FC values of significantly altered transcripts (n = 27) were uploaded to IPA and each identifier was mapped to its corresponding gene object in the IKB.

Genes from the table of cellular biofunctions (Table 1) were merged with the Table A2 in Appendix to filter the differentially expressed genes according to putative candidates for palatal deformities. Some of the genes listed were identified as being important for palatogenesis in mouse, but not directly associated with human cases of cleft palate and thus remain \"putative\" cleft palate genes in the latter, as labeled with asterisk ( * ) in the Table A2 in Appendix. Overlapping genes (n = 11) were presented in Table 2 with their FC and p-values. Among these genes, EDN1, INHBA, TGF\u03b21, TGF\u03b22, RUNX1, LHX8, SNAI1, PDGFC, and PIGA were upregulated; while only SMAD3 was downregulated in response to TGF\u03b2treatment. Intriguingly, TGF\u03b2R1 was upregulated with TGF\u03b21 treatment and downregulated with TGF\u03b22 treatment; which correlates with FIGURE 3 | Direct and indirect relations of most differentially expressed genes with TGF\u03b2. Affymetrix probe identifiers and FC values of significantly altered transcripts (n = 27) were uploaded to IPA and each identifier was mapped to its corresponding gene object in the IKB. Interactions were then queried between these gene objects and all other gene objects stored within IPA to generate a set of direct interaction networks that were merged. Networks with the highest number of molecules were selected, overlaid with TGF\u03b2 molecules, and organized using Path Designer of IPA. Upregulated transcripts were highlighted with orange (A); and downregulated transcripts were highlighted with green (B). Types of molecules were annotated in the legend in the box. isoform-specific receptor requirement in TGF\u03b2 signaling (Rojas et al., 2009). Ingenuity pathway analysis, a knowledge based program to generate relevant and interacting biological networks, was used to determine how the differentially expressed overlapping genes might interact to facilitate cellular biofunctions. A direct interaction network of the orofacial deformity susceptibility genes, overlaid with clustered cellular biofunctions crucial for development and maturation of the palatal mesenchyme was generated and is presented in Figure 6. Finally, the localization of differentially expressed genes within the canonical TGF\u03b2 pathway was illustrated by using the IPA Path Designer in FIGURE 4 | Hierarchical clustering (heatmap) analysis of differentially expressed transcripts.

These strengths and the momentum are powerful. Though the iOS devices allow users to access the entire Internet, the hardware exists in a closed platform of iTunes and the App Store. The popularity and elegance of Apple's product offer ample opportunity to application providers, but Apple's supreme power in the ecosystem places them in a vulnerable position.

                    "full_context": "The United States, with its large smartphone market, has an industry architecture that is important to consider. For example, the network carriers in the U.S. play a prominent role in everything from customer engagement to handset development. In Jacobides' language, there are designed factors (e.g., multiple incompatible network standards, primarily GSM and CDMA) and emergent factors (culture of subscription-based usage plans), both of which increase switching costs and lock-in customers, that contribute to this. Carriers such as Verizon and AT&T not only operate the network, but also sell handsets and provide content, in essence vying to be a one-stop shop for end-users in their mobile experience. The degree to which handset manufacturers must work with the carriers is reflected in the pricing for smartphones in the U.S.-typically $200 or less if the customer signs up for a 1-or 2-year contract, a fraction of the full retail price. This subsidization of the purchase price, which the carrier earns back through monthly subscription revenue, creates a very high barrier to entry for independent retailers or handset manufacturers wanting to sell standalone smartphones direct to customers. 1 Carriers in the U.S. typically set their product requirements and OEM product development is carried out accordingly. Apple was the exception, as U.S. carriers (AT&T and now Verizon) accepted the Apple product as designed. 2 In addition to the expected and necessary collaboration-for example, between carriers and chip designers to optimize network performance-carriers are making decisions about how data is consumed on their networks (e.g., charging for data plans) and what services can be used (e.g., Skype or other VoIP clients). Further, as part of their effort to lock-in customers, carriers seek to provide unique services, such as proprietary content or applications that distinguish the phones that they sell. A key question is whether firms that focus on the lucrative U.S. market, and who must therefore operate within the roles and influences of the industry architecture there, must adapt their strategies in other markets where the architecture is different."

We reasoned that contigs that were suffi cient for designing effi cient enrichment probes should also be able to inform sequence assembly, avoiding the need for computationally demanding and often unsatisfactory de novo methods. We mapped reads to the 278 references using the relatively indel-tolerant BWA program (v. 0.7.12; Li and Durbin, 2009 ;Li, 2013 ), with the default settings for paired-end data; fi nally, the resultant contigs were imported into Geneious. Consensus sequences were extracted from these contigs in Geneious using default settings, including trimming the consensus to the length of the reference sequence. Each locus was aligned individually using MAFFT 7.017 ( Katoh et al., 2009 ) with default settings. One of the loci (labeled Locus 4 in the probe panel, wherein loci are numbered in order of descending length; data available from the Dryad Digital Repository: http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4cn66 [ Folk et al., 2015 ]) was found to yield only partial sequences from many taxa, resulting in large amounts of missing data (see Results); this has been excluded from the analyses, leaving 277 effectively enriched loci."

PCR conditions used an annealing temperature of 60 \u00b0 C, an elongation time of 45 s, 15 total cycles, and 10 \u03bc L of template. Target-enriched library pools were verified for size distribution on an Agilent Bioanalyzer, and quantified with an Illumina library quantification kit (KAPA, Wilmington, Massachusetts, USA). Because adapter dimers were problematic for one of the pools, all pools were cleaned following the paramagnetic bead-based cleaning procedure in the NEBNext protocol but with 0.8 volumes of AMPure beads to 1 volume of enriched library. For all target arbitrarily excluded the last 49.3% of the intron matrix (introns of approximately loci 88-277) to yield a matrix of equivalent length to the exon matrix. Each of these two matrices was analyzed in RAxML with an unpartitioned GTR-GAMMA model, with 1000 bootstrap replicates."

(2004) for a review]. Many studies have searched for higher level organization and modularity within the network by breaking it up into relatively independent modules, which may correspond to biologically relevant complexes (Han et al., 2004;Kashtan and Alon, 2005;Spirin et al., 2003). Several algorithms have been designed in recent years which use interaction information alone to identify functional modules and complexes. Most of these algorithms identify dense regions of high connectivity with relatively low connectivity to the rest of network (Bader and Hogue, 2003;Krogan et al., 2006). These dense sub-graphs are treated as potential functional modules. For instance, MCODE (Bader and Hogue, 2003) first identifies putative complexes using local network * To whom correspondence should be addressed. density and then filters away those which do not contain subgraphs with minimal degree two. Another graph-based method, MCL (Dongen et al., 2000), simulates a large number of quenched random walks of varying length from each node of the graph using an expansion step and combines this with an inflation step to partition the graph into subsets that do not have paths between them."

More than five independent transgenic lines were produced and tested for responsiveness by GUS histochemical assays. Three representative lines were selected for detailed characterization and showed the same expression pattern under all conditions tested."

(S. sonnei Ss046, S. flexneri 2a str. 301, S. flexneri 2a str), or even long CRISPRs such as in Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14.

The difficulty resides especially in the identification of boundaries, which is very important to extract the correct spacers and compare DRs. In fact, the consensus DR is selected as the maximal repeat which occurs the most in the whole underlying genome sequence with respect to the forward and the reverse complement directions (since two CRISPRs having the same DR consensus may be in opposite directions). Thus, ambiguity in the choice of a DR will be eliminated in the case of presence of similar DRs in other CRISPRs of the related genomic sequence. However, if occurrence numbers are equal, more than a single DR consensus candidate are kept and later compared. Given a candidate consensus DR, the pattern search program fuzznuc of the EMBOSS package ( 28) is applied to get DRs' positions in the related cluster. As the first or the last DR in a CRISPR may be diverged/truncated, a mismatch of one-third of the DR length is allowed between the flanking DRs and the candidate consensus DR, whereas smaller nucleotide differences are allowed between the other DRs to take into account possible single mutations. In case of multiple DR candidates, a score is computed and the best one (minimum) is picked. This score favours candidates which are encountered more frequently, rather than consensus DR showing less internal mismatches."

Several software were used by different authors to identify these particular repeats but usually a manual discard of background was necessary, and generally some CRISPR clusters were missed or neglected, especially the shortest one (less than three motifs). This is the case, for example, of Tandem Repeat Finder (17) when considering a motif (DR \u00fe spacer) as a degenerate repeat (10,18), or Locating Uniform poly-Nucleotide Areas (LUNA), a program for finding degenerate repeats in microbial genomes on a desktop computer. The repeats can be filtered using several parameters including length, distance and level of conservation. LUNA was used especially for finding CRISPRs in archaea (4,15). Another program, Patscan (19) a pattern-matching tool that searches sequences fitting the introduced pattern, was applied."

Using the Blast in Grids (BiG) service (Aparicio et al., 2007), we have run BLASTX searches for several metagenomes against the realease 159 (April 2007) of GenBank non-redundant protein database, extracted the homologues found for each putative ORF [following the procedure described in Tamames and Moya (2008)] and assigned the ORF to the taxon of its best hit (where different threshold of minimum identity have been used). Next, we have collected the dates of creation of the GenBank entries of these hits. In this way, we can simulate the results that we would have obtained in the past, by restricting the list of homologues to those already present in the database in a particular date, which allowed us to explore how the results change as the database grows. The experiment was repeated for different metagenomes and different taxonomic depths. One of the results is shown in the Figure 1A, for a farm soil metagenome (Tringe et al., 2005). Each row corresponds to a single ORF, displaying the colour of the class to which it would have been assigned in different dates. The plot shows clearly that many of the assignments have changed, even in recent times (between 10% and 20% of the assignments at class level have varied in the last 2 years). This can be easily seen in Figure 1B, which shows the accumulated number of changes with respect to previous dates. Several trends are noticeable: (1) The rate of change does not decrease in recent times, instead it clearly increases for most cases. This trend of change can be noticed even for broad taxonomic ranks such as phylum: for instance, Acidobacteria phylum is now recognized as one of the most abundant taxa in many soils (Barns et al., 1999), but until recently no sequences were assigned to it. This indicates that the full diversity of these communities is still not well described in the current databases, and that best hit approach for taxonomic classification is at least risky. (2) Although most changes consist in the assignment of previously unclassified ORFs, the classification for many ORFs has also changed. (3) Abrupt changes occur in response to the availability of complete genomes, especially from close species to those represented in the metagenomes. Again for Acidobacteria, We analyzed 60 000 randomly selected sequences from the full metagenome, using blastx searches and a threshold of 60% minimum identity between query and hit proteins. Each row in the plot corresponds to a single ORF, showing with colours how the assignment has varied in time (colours indicate different taxonomic classes). (B) This plot shows the accumulated number of ORFs that changed their assignment between consecutive months (expressed as the ratio of number of changes/total number of ORFs), for different metagenomes (Blue, whale fall; Red, human gut; Green, farm soil; Black, Sargasso sea). The changes are divided between new assignments (the ORF was previously unassigned, dashed lines) and assignment changes (assignment to a different taxon, solid lines). The figure also emphasizes three dates in which many assignments change, in accordance to the release of particular complete genomes of importance for the description of these microbial communities."

The non-redundant (NR) patent sequence databases comprise two-level nucleotide and protein sequence clusters (NRNL1, NRNL2, NRPL1 and NRPL2) based on sequence identity (level-1) and patent family (level-2). Annotation from the source entries in these databases is merged and enhanced with additional information from the patent literature and biological context. Corrections in patent publication numbers, kind-codes and patent equivalents significantly improve the data quality. Data are available through various user interfaces including web browser, downloads via FTP, SRS, Dbfetch and EBI-Search. Sequence similarity/homology searches against the databases are available using BLAST, FASTA and PSI-Search. In this article, we describe the data collection and annotation and also outline major changes and improvements introduced since 2009. Apart from data growth, these changes include additional annotation for singleton clusters, the identifier versioning for tracking entry change and the entry mappings between the two-level databases."

A subset of the identified miRNAtarget modulations was further validated by qRT-PCR in cardiac biopsies (Fig. 4) and in a cell culture system (Supplementary Fig. 3). Gene interaction and pathway analysis of global gene expression changes. To facilitate the interpretation of the complex gene expression changes observed in the different experimental groups, we used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (IPA), exploring for enriched biological functions and pathways. We applied a low-stringency approach, prioritizing sensitivity to maximize the identification of the potentially involved categories."

By aligning the overlapping regions of the deduced protein sequences of the newly obtained fragment and the incomplete sequence in Ensembl, we detected an amino acid substitution. The comparison with other vertebrate ENC proteins clearly showed that this is a highly conserved residue (asparagine). Therefore, we assume that the lysine residue of the Ensembl chicken ENC3 protein was caused by a sequencing error, which is also plausible with respect to the stretch of \"N\"s.

A non-redundant set of 28,620 FLcDNA sequences 13,14 was mapped to the Haruna Nijo scaffolds. Blastn mapping revealed that 27,784 FLcDNAs (97%) showed sequence similarities with the Haruna Nijo scaffolds. According to the results of the FLcDNA mapping to scaffolds, we analysed mapping coverage of 5\u2032-end of each FLcDNA on Haruna Nijo scaffolds. The ratio of completely mapped FLcDNAs, which were mapped from the first nucleotide sequence, was <10%. This shows that most of the FLcDNAs do not have the complete sequences on the 5\u2032-end side exon. To analyse additional mapped FLcDNAs, we relaxed the mapping position to the first 10 nucleotide sequences. Then, the ratio of mapped FLcDNA was raised to 80% (Supplementary Fig. S3). GC contents and CG-skew were analysed on the FLcDNAs having mapped 5\u2032-ends within 10 bp. The typical high GC contents and CG-skewed peaks at the transcription start sites were identified as previously observed in rice and Arabidopsis 32 (Supplementary Fig. S4)."

Most of them are from actinobacteria, except four; Rmet_0596 (Ralstonia metallidurans CH34, Betaproteobacteria), CHU_0600 (Cytophaga hutchinsonii ATCC 33406, Bacteroidetes), Ccel_0804 (Clostridium cellulolyticum H10, Firmicutes) and Ctha_1264 (Chloroherpeton thalassium ATCC 35110, Chlorobi). The list included reported ZAS factors such as RshA from M. tuberculosis (12,17,27) and a predicted ZAS RshA from C. glutamicum (25). Except for NCgl0852 from C. glutamicum, all ZAS genes are adjacent to ECF sigma factor genes. In M. tuberculosis and M. bovis strains, genes for ZAS (RshA) and sigma factor (SigH) are separated by a hypothetical ORF."

GI 50 of these cell lines were 1-5 uM to gefitinib and 4uM-\u226510uM to EMD 121463. These cell lines were essentially resistant to both gefitinib and EMD 121463 as single agents. The inhibitory effect of combined treatment with gefitinib and EMD 121463 was significantly enhanced compared with single agent therapy in MDA-MB-468 cells (P=0.002) but not in the other cell lines (MDA-MB-231, HCC1395, and T47D) (Fig 1). However, when data were analyzed in Calcusyn software, synergism was also documented at different concentration combinations in the other cell lines (Table 1). These experiments indicate a dose dependent synergistic interaction between gefitinib and EMD 121463 in suppressing growth of triple-negative breast cancer cells."

We found that ABT-737 alone at 1.1 mM caused no cytotoxicity, consistent with results shown in Fig. 1A, but ABT-737 increased the effect of Bortezomib on relative cell viability (Fig. 2A,B). To quantify whether these drug combinations exhibited synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effects, we used Calcusyn software to calculate the combination index (CI) value for each experimental combination (supplementary material Fig. S1). CI values less than, equal to, or greater than one indicate synergy, additivity, or antagonism, respectively. Most of the CI values were less than 0.7 (indicating synergy), and many CI values were less than 0.3 (indicating strong synergy). These results show that a majority of the combination conditions of ABT-737 with Bortezomib displayed strong synergistic killing effects for these melanoma cell lines (supplementary material Fig. S1). We have observed similar results in treating several additional melanoma cell lines (supplementary material Figs. S2, S3 and data not shown)."

FITC-Annexin V and PI were added to the fixed cells for 20 min in darkness at room temperature. Subsequently, Annexin V binding buffer was added to the mixture prior to measuring the fluorescence using a FACSort flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Cell apoptosis was analyzed using CellQuest 3.0 software (Becton Dickinson). The results demonstrated that a significantly higher rate of apoptosis was present in the KUMA5 cells overexpressing Hath1 compared with that of the control groups (Fig. 4). In addition, a significantly lower rate of apoptosis was observed in the KUMA5 cells transfected with pGenesil-1-Hath1 compared with that of the control groups (Fig. 4). Therefore, these results suggest that overexpression of Hath1 may promote apoptosis in KUMA5 cells."

Staining with biotin conjugated mAb was followed by incubation with streptavidin-PerCP-Cy5.5 (Becton Dickinson). Before staining, the anti-CD86 mAb was labeled by PE conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probe) for 5 min at room temperature. The excess of PE-goat anti-mouse IgG was neutralized by excess purified mouse IgG (Sigma). After the staining, the cells were fixed and analyzed using a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur\u2122: Becton Dickinson). Background of the fluorescence was adjusted using following isotype-control: FITC-conjugated mouse IgG2a (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, U.S.A.), FITCconjugated rat IgG2a (eBioscience) and biotin-conjugated rat IgG2a (eBioscience). To determine the expression intensity of the surface antigens specified above, the mean peak channel of the fluorescence intensity was calculated by software (CellQuest\u2122: Becton Dickinson) after the FCM analysis and expressed as mean expression intensity (MEI)."

For Sanger sequencing of the 5' UTR and exon 1 of the BRCA1 gene, a 3.4 kb fragment on chromosome 17 (41,277,280,530 bps, Ensembl release 64) was divided into 11 amplicons (Table S1). For amplicons 1-5 and 8, the PCR reaction mixture (25 \u03bcl) consisted of 2.5 \u03bcl 10x PCR buffer, 20 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5 \u03bcl 10 mM dNTP mix, 1 \u03bcl (10 pmol) of each forward and reverse primer, 0. the cytoplasmic pellet and stored at -80\u00b0C. The protein concentration was measured according to Bradford, using Roti Quant (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). Customized antibody microarrays for quantification of BRCA1 (antibody #sc-1553, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) and several other DNA repair-associated proteins (ATM, BRCA2, MLH1, RAD51 and TP53) were prepared by spotting triplicate drops, each containing approximately 0.5 pg antibody onto nitrocellulose-coated slides (Oncyte, nitrocellulose 16 multi-pad slides, Grace Bio-Labs, Bend, OR), using a sciFLEX-ARRAYER 3 non-contact spotter (Scienion, Berlin, Germany). Antibodies against \u03b2-actin (ACTB) (#A5441, Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) served as positive, spotting buffer as negative control. Slides were stored at 4\u00b0C in dry condition. Nuclear proteins were labeled with an amine reactive fluorine dye, which forms a covalent amide bond between the primary amines of proteins. Two micrograms of protein and 0.12 \u03bcl fluorescent dye (Dylight 649 NHS Ester, Pierce, Rockford, IL) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Then, excess fluorescent dye was inactivated by adding 100 mM glycine to the reaction. Prior to use, antibody microarrays were covered with 16-pad FAST frame hybridization chambers (Whatman, Maidstone, UK). Unspecific binding sites were blocked for 1 h at 4\u00b0C with 120 \u03bcl PBS containing 4% non-fat dry milk per subarray, followed by three washes with 120 \u03bcl PBS each for 10 min. Labeled protein samples were incubated on subarrays overnight at 4\u00b0C. Afterwards, the slides were washed two times for 15 min with PBS, 5% Tween 20 and two times for 15 min with HPLC-grade water. Finally, the slides were dried in a SpeedVac and scanned with a high-resolution confocal Affymetrix array scanner 428 TM (Affymetrix, High Wycombe, UK). Slide images were analyzed using the TM4 Spotfinder (version 3.1.1) software (Dana Faber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). Background subtraction was performed according to the formula: spot intensity = mean intensity SP -[(sum bkg -sum top25 bkg)/(number of pixelSP -number of pixel top25 bkg)], where SP represents any spot, bkg the corresponding background and top25 bkg the top 25% of background pixel. Microarray data were analyzed using log10 transformation, z score and z ratio calculations. 47 Three biological replicates (using protein samples from different cell cultures of the affected and the healthy twin) were performed for each experiment."

Quantitative measurements of size and distance were performed using ImageJ 28 and graphically presented and analysed using Microsoft Excel. Eyespot diameter and the width of a given ring and core were measured along the line that passes through the focus of that eyespot for the mandarin fish. Similar measurements were taken in the spotted ray except the black ring width, which was calculated by subtracting the core diameter from the whole eyespot size and then dividing it by a factor of two. Five representative eyespots from each array of an individual ray were used for the measurements."

The PoP program is built on the assumption that the best people to teach the skills needed in a career are the people who have been successful in that career. So the PoP program brings in successful people who are at a point in their career when they want to give back to society by teaching students how the liberal arts are used in the real world. It pairs these professors of the practice with academic liberal arts professor sponsors. These sponsors work with the professors of the practice on teaching the course. They do so by giving the PoP suggestions and guidance in teaching. The sponsor's role is to insure that the course both maintains academic rigor and asks broad liberal arts questions in addition to providing contextual knowledge of the field being taught. 4 For example, in Middlebury's accounting and budgeting course, students go back to Luigi Pacioli's introduction of double entry bookkeeping and consider how its general adoption fundamentally changed society. They also consider how accounting might change for triple bottom line corporations. In finance, in addition to becoming facile with dcf models in Excel, students consider the evolution of financial ideas over the last 50 years and how developments in the science of finance changed the practice of finance, not necessarily for the better."

In this context, assessment of models3 robustness to noise and imaging protocol differences together with post-processing and tuning strategies are key tasks to be addressed in order to move towards successful clinical applications. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of Random Forest classifiers trained using different structural MRI measures, with and without neuroanatomical constraints in the detection and prediction of AD in terms of accuracy and between-cohort robustness. From The ADNI database, 185 AD, and 225 healthy controls (HC) were randomly split into training and testing datasets. 165 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were distributed according to the month of conversion to dementia (4-year follow-up). Structural 1.5-T MRI-scans were processed using Freesurfer segmentation and cortical reconstruction. Using the resulting output, AD/HC classifiers were trained. Training included model tuning and performance assessment using out-of-bag estimation. Subsequently the classifiers were validated on the AD/HC test set and for the ability to predict MCI-to-AD conversion. Models3 between-cohort robustness was additionally assessed using the AddNeuroMed dataset acquired with harmonized clinical and imaging protocols. In the ADNI set, the best AD/HC sensitivity/specificity (88.6%/92.0%test set) was achieved by combining cortical thickness and volumetric measures. The Random Forest model resulted in significantly higher accuracy compared to the reference classifier (linear Support Vector Machine). The models trained using parcelled and highdimensional (HD) input demonstrated equivalent performance, but the former was more effective in terms of computation/memory and time costs. The sensitivity/specificity for detecting MCI-to-AD conversion (but not AD/HC classification performance) was further improved from 79.5%/75%-83.3%/81.3% by a combination of morphometric measurements with ApoE-genotype and demographics (age, sex, education). When applied to the independent AddNeuroMed cohort, the best ADNI models produced equivalent performance without substantial accuracy drop, suggesting good robustness sufficient for future clinical implementation."

ADNI   It starts and proceeds in two directions aimed at extraction of parcelled and highdimensional measurements using Freesurfer software (blue box). After this part had completed, the extracted measures underwent steps for outlier detection, and the resulted output was used in further Random Forest classification runs (in R programming language gray box). We additionally tuned our models using recursive feature elimination and m try -parameter adjustment (which defines the number of predictors randomly sampled at each node of the classifier). Finally, feature importance vectors from the best models were either mapped into the brain space (for the high-dimensional data) or plotted (for the parcelled input). We are very thankful to EMBL-EBI Community for the provided R-could account and personally to Andrew Tikhonov for his incredibly valuable help and technical input while working with rWorkbench. We would also like to acknowledge Sveinung Fjaer (University of Bergen) for his assistance during our \"heavy test-runs\" and his patience in bringing the computers back. Max Kuhn (Pfizer Inc.), author and maintainer of the 'caret' R package, is also acknowledged for his input during the code preparation."

Nonparametric bootstrapping and permutation (Monte Carlo) procedures were realized with the number of replicates and/or random permutations as large as possible (but no less than 1 million).

First, the Google Scholar and EconLIT search engines were used, searching for the key phrases \"labor supply child care elasticity\" and \"labor force participation and child care prices\" as well as variations of these key phrases that replace \"labor supply\" with \"employment\" and child care with \"child care\" throughout the construction period. The second source of literature was the reference lists of the articles found in the initial search. Third, the literature review of Blau and Currie (2006) and the literature review of Wrohlich (2006) were extensively used, the former for mostly studies from the United States and Canada, and the latter for studies from Europe. Forty-four estimates are included in Table 1 for analysis from around 36 English language articles published between 1988 and 2010. 2 The studies estimating only the hours elasticity such as Heckman (1974) and Averett et al. (1997) were excluded since the comparison with participation elasticity is not possible in terms of the elasticity sizes."

It has been cited 650 times, and, as shown in Figure 3, it remains a key reference today. In this section, we investigate the robustness of this study's findings to outliers. 2 The sample covers 112 countries over the period 1970-1997, the dependent variable is FDI inflows as a share of GDP, and the proxy for democracy is Polity IV score (see Table 5 for a description). We focus on the key regression of the paper: model 10 in Table 4. The estimates suggest that a fully autocratic government (score of 0) becoming fully democratic (score of 20) can be expected to attract 0.4% more FDI flows as a percentage of GDP). Given that the average level of FDI flows in the sample is 1.3% of GDP, this is a sizeable amount."

FAK and its phosphorylation at Tyr-397 recruit a pool of active Src to mediate localized tyrosine phosphorylation of substrates at focal adhesions. A balance between tyrosine phosphorylation at focal adhesions and invadopodia is required for proper dynamics and cell migration. Depletion of FAK releases active Src to mediate enhanced phosphorylation of substrates at invadopodia, which impairs focal adhesion dynamics but enhances the formation and dynamics of invadopodia; however, this is not sufficient for effective invasion. (Artym et al., 2006) and subsequently coating with 10 \u00b5g/ml fibronectin for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Matrigel (BD) coverslips were prepared by coating a thin layer of a 1:10 dilution of Matrigel for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Cells were cultured on coverslips for 16 h, fixed, and stained with antibodies. Coverslips were imaged using a 60\u00d7/1.40 oil objective on an inverted microscope (1X-70; Olympus) equipped with a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (CoolSNAP FX; Photometrics) or an inverted microscope (TE300; Nikon) equipped with a cooled CCD camera (Orca II; Hamamatsu Photonics). Images were captured into MetaVue (version 6.2; MDS Analytical Technologies) or MetaMorph imaging software (version 7.1; MDS Analytical Technologies). At least 40 cells were counted in each of at least three separate experiments performed on separate days. Dotlike structures containing cortactin and/or actin were scored as invadopodia. For ratiometric analysis, images were first subjected to high-pass filtration based on the water algorithm (Zamir et al., 1999) to remove diffuse background fluorescence. The images were thresholded based on the vinculin image because it had the largest signal to noise ratio, providing the clearest distinction between focal adhesions and background. The thresholded vinculin image was used to generate a binary image in which values at focal adhesions equal 1 and all other values equal 0. A ratio image of vinculin/pY416 Src was generated, and high frequency noise was removed with a low-pass filter. Ratio images were displayed with similar nucleocytoplasmic background as a control for possible differences in staining. Ratiometric images presented are representative of at least 50 cells visualized by immunofluorescence."

Positive change scores indicate a benefit to parenting or well-being. A per protocol analysis compared outcomes for families in which parents did not attend an FLNP session to outcomes for families in which parents attended six or more FLNP sessions. For both treatment allocated and per protocol analysis, we report complete cases analysis results for all outcomes. In all analyses, we fitted multilevel models with a random effects term for course and for outcomes corresponding to individual child data and a random effects term for family. For the families in the control, the betweenfamily variance was assumed to be equal to that between families in the intervention group attending different courses; terms in the model were thus included as if each control family formed their own course, so that they contributed to estimating the between course random effect variance. For sensitivity analysis, we performed multiple imputation using predictive mean matching 70 and results are reported for the primary  For each outcome, we created 10 imputed datasets using the Hmisc package in the R statistical programme and combined the analysis results from the 10 imputed datasets using Rubin rules. 70 "

For all treatments, a pan-caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk (Bachem-Holding AG, Weil am Rhein, Germany), was added 30 min before drug addition and imaging to establish apoptosis specificity of the assay. Before imaging, live nuclei were stained with HOECHST-33342 at 100 ng ml \u00c0 1 . All experiments were performed in triplicate and at least three times.

Briefly, the background was digitally subtracted from the image using the macro provided, and then the lanes were manually designated with identically sized rectangles adequate to fully enclose the Huntingtin band in each lane. The 1D lane profile plots were generated by the software (representing the density of the image summed over horizontal raster lines of each rectangle), then the area under each lane's plot at the peak corresponding to the Huntingtin band was computed. These values were normalized by dividing by the value for the density of the tubulin band in the same lane obtained by the same method."

This is because the amount of active RSK1 is only a fraction of the total RSK1 and its translocation to the nucleus creates a higher concentration in the nucleus than the larger cytoplasmic compartment. Because of this concentration difference, it is difficult to clearly see the cytoplasmic active RSK1 by immunocytochemistry with anti-phospho-T573 antibody. However, by cell fractionation (see Figure 6C later in this paper) and ImageJ analyses (see Figure 5 later in this paper), active endogenous RSK1 is detectable in the cytoplasm."

Cycle threshold (C( T )) values were determined by the second differential maximum method as calculated by the Rotor-Gene software. Calculation of relative mRNA levels was done by using the 2 [-DDC( T )] method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001), where the C( T ) values of the mRNA level were normalized to the C( T ) values of rp49 mRNA in the same sample and mRNA levels represented as relative fold change over control. C( T ) values used were the means of triplicate repeats. Experiments were repeated three times. RNA immunoprecipitation data was also analyzed using the comparative C( T ) method, factoring in the 10-fold difference in RNA used for input and immunoprecipitation. For each mRNA and each experimental condition, results are expressed as a percentage of the total input RNA. All primers used in this study are listed in supplementary material Table S4."

These EVs were shown by pulse-chase experiments to be derived from endosomes and were therefore bona fide exosomes (5). In addition, CTB could be used to extract endosome-derived MSC EVs from an MSC-conditioned medium. These CTB-EVs carried exosome-associated proteins and had a flotation density of 1.09\u00c11.17 g/mL. In our extraction protocol, CTB effectively extracts at least 96% of CD81 in the conditioned medium (5). Here, we determine the proteome of these CTB-EVs and CTB-EV depleted MSC EV preparation by mass spectrometry as previously described (10). 1,806 proteins were detected in the CTB-bound fraction and 1,547 were present in the CTB-depleted fraction (Supplementary File 1). 987 proteins were found in both fractions, suggesting that these 987 proteins are likely proteins commonly found in most EVs. The observation that 819 and 560 proteins were detected only in either CTB-bound or -depleted fraction respectively indicated that CTB-EVs represent a distinct class of EVs and that there were possibly other EV types beside the CTB-bound EVs (Fig. 1a). The proteins in the CTB-bound fraction and CTB-depleted fraction were functionally clustered into biological process, molecular functions and pathways by the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis platform (Ingenuity Systems, Mountain View, CA). From the analysis of the CTB-bound fraction and CTB-depleted fraction, we respectively selected a set of 20 pathways that had the least likelihood of the clustered proteins being associated with a pathway due to random chance, that is, the lowest p value. There were many shared pathways in these 2 sets. There were also pathways that were unique to either the CTB-bound or depleted fractions (Fig. 1b)."

For each binding analysis, a titration series was prepared with varying concentrations of the respective peptide as indicated in the plots. All curves were plotted with the KaleidaGraph software, and the thermophoresis signals were fitted with the Hill equation corrected for the minimum (Min) and maximum (Max) values of the binding curve: Y(c) = Min+(Max \u00c0 Min)/(1+EC 50 / c 0 pep ) n , with Y (c) being the thermophoresis signal, c 0 pep the variable concentration of the respective peptide, EC 50 the concentration where half of the oligonucleotide is bound and n being the Hill-coefficient. Thermophoresis signals were normalized to fraction bound (X) by X = [Y(c) \u00c0 Min]/(Max \u00c0 Min), error bars (std) were normalized by std norm = std(c)/(Max \u00c0 Min), and both were plotted and fitted as described earlier in the text. K D values were not determined, as the gel retardation experiments showed that multiple protein-DNA complexes appear at higher peptide concentrations (Figure 3B)."

To simulate the effects of acetazolamide, it was hypothesized to act centrally by reducing the oscillation, originating in the damping control of smooth pursuit, which underlies most INS waveforms."

On the query result page, click the link containing operon ID ('4015') to get to the detailed target operon page. The user can see that this operon has 1476 similar operons. By clicking on the link '1476' on the 'Similar Operon' row, the user can see the list of all its similar operons. In order to apply the prediction tool for cis-regulatory motifs, the user needs to select a number of similar operons to the query operon by checking the checkbox on relevant operon rows, and then click the button 'Add Selected Operons', which adds all the selected operons to the working environment. To see which operons have been added to the working environment, the user can click the button 'Selected Operons' on the main menu. Then check the checkboxes for the interested operons and click the button 'Show Upstream Regions' to get and show the promoter regions of the selected operons.

Two experimental and two control samples (mock purification from a Tetrahymena cell line not expressing TAP-Pot1a) were separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and visualized by colloidal Coomassie. The entire lane was excised, divided into 16 pieces, and prepared for MS analysis by in-gel reduction, alkylation, and trypsin digestion. The eluted samples were then analyzed by reverse-phase nano-electrospray tandem MS as described previously (Mead et al., 2010). The MS/MS spectra emanating from the gel slices for each lane were concatenated and searched against tryptic peptides predicted from the Tetrahymena genome (TTA1_08302006.pep; ftp://ftp.ciliate.org/Tetrahymena/sequence/) using the X!Tandem (www.thegpm.org/TANDEM) and Mascot (Matrix Science, Boston, MA) search engines. Putative interacting proteins were those identified in both experimental samples and not in either control sample."

Each subject is asked to roll a virtual die and report the outcome of the die roll either by completing a self-report or confirmation report. We find strong evidence of lying in both treatments. We also find that the effect of confirmation report is heterogenous across prefilled number, gender, and roller status. Overall, we find that people are more likely to confirm the truth than to self-report the truth, and more likely to confirm a lie than to tell a lie. We attribute our findings to intrinsic costs which are influenced through the impact of confirmation reports on moral-lying costs and decision-making costs. 25 Almost all countries with a prepopulated tax system either limit to their system to (or began with) taxpayers with only wage income that is easily monitored for accuracy. 26 According to a 2008 report by Quality Planning company, the car insurance industry missed out on $15.9 billion in revenues of which more than $3 billion is due to underreported vehicle mileage. 27 These include asking the customer, asking the agent, historical odometer readings, mileage models, and telematics using an after-market device, smartphone OEM-based or smartphone odometer app (Cantwell 2015)."

To assess whether relationships based on perceptions differed from those based on objective data, we ran a survey using Amazon Mechanical Turk (https://www.mturk.com) to explore attitudes towards blood donations across 78 high-and low-income countries. The survey and overview of the results are available with the online appendix. The results show that, similar to the objective data, controlling for a country's income, respondents from volunteer collection countries are more likely to believe their country is collecting blood effi ciently and distributing it fairly (p < .05). However, respondent's perceptions of the safety to either the donor or recipient do not vary with the percent of blood collected from volunteers (p > .85).

Starr (2002) documents that over 570,000 additional units of blood were collected Starr (2002) documents that over 570,000 additional units of blood were collected by the Red Cross immediately after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, with an estimated by the Red Cross immediately after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, with an estimated 100,000 to 300,000 units eventually discarded (plus the time and equipment wasted 100,000 to 300,000 units eventually discarded (plus the time and equipment wasted collecting these units), for an estimated minimum cost of $21-63 million (using collecting these units), for an estimated minimum cost of $21-63 million (using the $211 unit cost reported above). Well-publicized images of lines outside blood the $211 unit cost reported above). Well-publicized images of lines outside blood donor centers immediately after 9/11 likely exacerbated the problem by signaling donor centers immediately after 9/11 likely exacerbated the problem by signaling that donating was the normatively appropriate behavioral response (Cialdini et al. that donating was the normatively appropriate behavioral response (Cialdini et al. 1993), despite virtually no change in demand for blood. 1993), despite virtually no change in demand for blood. Of course, one option for collection agencies to address excess supply is to Of course, one option for collection agencies to address excess supply is to separate the red cells, platelets, and plasma, with the idea that at least the plasma separate the red cells, platelets, and plasma, with the idea that at least the plasma can be stored, although the red cells would still be discarded after six weeks. This can be stored, although the red cells would still be discarded after six weeks. This option is limited by centrifuge and fi ltration capacity constraints. When a disaster option is limited by centrifuge and fi ltration capacity constraints. When a disaster response is local, supply can be shipped to other locations having centrifuge and response is local, supply can be shipped to other locations having centrifuge and fi ltration capacity. However, when disaster responses are spread over a larger area fi ltration capacity. However, when disaster responses are spread over a larger area or are national in scope, there is nowhere to send the excess supply. Yet another or are national in scope, there is nowhere to send the excess supply. Yet another option is for collection agencies to turn away volunteer donors, though this policy option is for collection agencies to turn away volunteer donors, though this policy has not usually been followed for fear that volunteers may take this as a signal that has not usually been followed for fear that volunteers may take this as a signal that they should not bother donating in the future. they should not bother donating in the future."

These were used to gain a deeper understanding of how a web portal could facilitate the use of bioinformatics tools by biologists. These studies are described in detail elsewhere (Letondal and Amanatian, 2004). The results showed the principal needs of biologists to be: (1) a stable and predictable set of known tools integrated in a portal designed for inexperienced users; (2) an overview of the analyses and careful organization of results; (3) reusability features to re-execute previous commands; and (4) userdefined and ready-to-use analysis pipelines, similar to benchmarked protocols. We also concluded that caution should be taken regarding advanced features. Indeed, (5) biologists are often sceptical about sophisticated tools that are difficult to understand: they have to be able to anticipate the benefits that such tools may provide."

Though expediency of alternative transcription remains vague, very similar phenomenon has been recently registered in eukaryotic genomes [see, e.g. ref. (40)]. In the chromosome of E. coli, there are several pairs of extensively overlapping genes encoding two proteins or a protein and an untranslated RNA. Many of them may be transcribed from common promoters. However genes hokC, tpr and ygeN with 5 0 -ends mapped within mokC, rttR and ygeO, respectively, as well as 46 transcripts partly matching sense strand and detected in the fraction of short RNAs by Vogel et al.

The assembled sequences were validated by PCR amplification of wheat cDNA followed by sequencing, resulting in a 1077-bp region.

Then 450 \u03bcl of ice-cold methanol was added to the sample. The fixed cells were washed three times with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and treated with RNase A (0.04 Kunitz units) for 30 minutes. The cells were then stained with 50 \u03bcg of propidium iodide per ml. Cell analysis was performed using a Coulter EPICS Elite EPS flow cytometer (Coulter Electronics; Miami, FL). The fraction of the total cell population present in each of the G 1 , S and G 2 /M cell cycle phases was obtained from DNA histograms by mathematical modeling using MPLUS software (Phoenix Flow Systems; San Diego, CA [28])."

Aim: Conduct systematic review and meta-analysis of available literature in English and Chinese about ECT in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia. Methods: English and Chinese databases were searched for studies published prior to May 20, 2015 regarding the efficacy and safety of the combined treatment of refractory schizophrenia with antipsychotic medications and ECT. Two researchers selected and evaluated studies independently using pre-defined criteria. Review Manager 5.3 software was used for data analysis. Results: A total of 22 randomized control studies, 18 of which were conducted in mainland China, were included in the analysis. Meta-analysis of data from 18 of the 22 studies with a pooled sample of 1394 individuals found that compared to treatment with antipsychotic medications alone, combined treatment with antipsychotic medications and ECT had significantly higher rates of achieving study-specific criteria of 'clinical improvement' (RR=1.25, 95%CI=1.14-1.37). Based on the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria, the quality of evidence for this assessment of efficacy was 'moderate'. However, the proportion of participants who experienced headache during the treatment was significantly higher in the combined treatment group (RR=9.10, 95%CI=3.97-20.86, based on a pooled sample of 517 from 8 studies) and the proportion who experienced memory impairment was also higher in the combined treatment group (RR=6.48, 95%CI=3.54-11.87, based on a pooled sample of 577 from 7 studies). The quality of evidence about these adverse events was rated as 'very low'. Conclusions: There are very few high quality randomized controlled clinical trials about the combination of antipsychotic medications and ECT in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia. This meta-analysis found that the combination of antipsychotic medications and ECT could improve psychiatric symptoms in patients with refractory schizophrenia, but the incomplete methodological information provided for most of the studies, publication bias (favoring studies with better outcomes in the combined treatment group), and the low quality of evidence about adverse outcomes, cognitive impairment, and overall functioning raise questions about the validity of the results."

Each block lasted 20 s and comprised four stimuli presented for 4 s each with an interstimulus interval of 1 s. Blocks were separated by a 2 s interblock interval. During task conditions (happy, fearful and neutral faces) participants were required to press one of two buttons to indicate the gender of the face using a button box held in the right hand. During fixation blocks, the participants were required to stare passively at a fixation cross. As with the facial blocks, four fixation cross stimuli were presented for 4 s each with an interstimulus interval of 1 s."

The last variable (previous treatment) was treated as a binary (yes or no), and the \"yes\" patients were labeled as \"received prior treatment\" [4]. Data analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics version 19.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptors and risk factors were compared using the independent samples t-test. Logistic regression was performed to compare M/XDR-TB cases to susceptible TB cases, and categorical variables were compared using the c 2 test, with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant."

Alvimopan, a gastrointestinal opioid receptor antagonist, was introduced in the protocol in July 2013 and was used in the last 101 patients. Patients did not routinely go to the ICU and home intravenous hydration was not used. We excluded from the analysis 4 patients who remained intubated post-operatively and could not be started on oral feeding. Results were compared with a pre-ERAS consecutive series of 177 RC patients from the three years prior to institution of the ERAS protocol, January 2009 to December 2011. Data were analyzed with SPSS \u00ae , version 19.0. A logistic regression model was performed to identify independent variables associated with readmission.

After scoring each variable, the treatment plans are determined according to the sum (Table 2). When scoring the variables of the TLICS, the morphology of injury, based on the radiology of the thoracolumbar injury, was classified as 3 types: 1) the compression type, 2) the translocation/rotation type and 3) the distraction type, and they were each scored as 1, 3 and 4 points, respectively. Additionally, concerning the presence of a burst fracture with the compression injuries, 1 point was added and thus it was scored as 2 points. For cases with multiple injuries of an identical type, no more than one injury was added to be scored. For cases with the combination of multiple different 110 / ASJ: Vol. 4, No. 2, 2010  types of injuries, only one injury type with the highest points was scored. Regarding the score of the injury in the posterior ligamentous complex, the cases with no other injury were 0 points, the cases with unclear injury were 2 points and the cases with apparent injury were scored as 3 points. As for the score of the neurologic status, the cases without neurological symptoms on the neurologic examination were 0 points, the cases with injury at the nerve root were 2 points and the cases with complete or incomplete neurological injury in the spinal cord and the conus medullaris were 2 points and 3 points, respectively. The cases with injury in the cauda equine were scored as 3 points (Figs. 1 and 2). Afterward, the intrarater reliability, as well as the interrater reliability of the score for each variable and sum, were evaluated by Cohen's unweighted k-value and Spearman' s rank order correlation. For the statistical distinction of the Kappa values, the distinction according to the guideline of Viera and Garrett [13] was applied (Table 3). In addition, the sensitivity and specificity were evaluated by the percent of correct treatment protocols according to the sum of the TLICS and the treatment actually performed on the patients. The validity of selecting treatment protocols according to this classification was also assessed. SPSS ver. 13.0 (SPSS Reliability and Validity of TLICS / 111 Fig. 1.

Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the effect of Orem's self-care model on perceived stress in adolescents with asthma. Methods: In this semi-experimental study conducted from April 2013 to February 2014, 64 asthmatic adolescents referring Shariati Hospital, Isfahan were enrolled by simple random sampling and the patients were assigned to two groups of control and intervention. Then, Orem's self-care model-based training was implemented throughout eight sessions of two hours each and the Cohen Perceived Stress Scale was administered to both groups prior to and two months after the completion of the training. The data were analyzed by descriptive and analytical statistics consisting of paired t-test, independent t-test, Chi-square and Mann-Whitney using SPSS Version 20. Results: Mean age of the participants was 14.15\u00b13.12 years in the intervention group and 15.21\u00b13.09 years in the control groups. 68.8% and 59.4% of the participants were male in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Independent t-test indicated a significant difference in the mean scores of perceived stress in the intervention (25.46\u00b15.31) and control groups (28.90\u00b15.27) after the training. Also, the result of paired t-test indicated a significant difference in the mean score of perceived stress between before (29.18\u00b15.27) and after (25.46\u00b15.31) training."

Thus, the two-part model was developed, which takes advantage of the basic rule of probability and splits into two parts-frequency (ie, any worse respiratory health status and the estimate included all the participants) and severity (ie, amount of worse respiratory health status and the estimate was based on a subsample of participants with respiratory health status greater than zero). 19 20 The two-part model used logit regression in the first part, and generalised linear model regression with the log link and \u03b3 distribution in the second part. 20 Both the unadjusted and adjusted (to determine independent predictors of the score) models were developed, which also included a sample with unknown values for the variables (from section I). All the section I variables were included in the adjusted model. Coefficients and their respective 95% CI were calculated. The results were considered significant when p values were less than or equal to 0.05. All data were analysed using STATAV.12 for Windows software. 21\n            "

Most submissions are inappropriate for the journal for one reason or another, often including level of specialization, style of exposition, or narrowness of focus. Others are good ideas that overlap to some extent with plans that have already been made. Still other suggestions offer possibilities and spark a discussion between the editors, the associate editors, and the author that sometimes leads to a JEP article. The journal typically receives roughly 200 unsolicited proposals each year. While the journal remains open to ideas and input from all sources, it remains the case that the overwhelming proportion of articles appearing in the journal are solicited by the editors and associate editors.

Varying the value of \u03b3 allows the researcher to assess the sensitivity of the results with respect to 'hidden bias'. Based on that, bounds for significance levels and confidence intervals can be derived. (For details see Rosenbaum (2002) and Aakvik (2001).

                    "full_context": "Tables 1 and Appendix Table 4 shows two major differences between the mergers we were able to examine and those that we excluded. First, overall, the excluded mergers took place in smaller markets. For instance, three of the 12 excluded mergers took place in very small markets (with fewer than 10 stores), and only one merger took place in a large market (Supervalu's purchases of the Jewel/Osco chain in Chicago). Second, in part because the excluded mergers took place in smaller markets, these markets tended to be more concentrated premerger. For example, Table 1 shows that three of the studied mergers studied took place in unconcentrated markets (with an HHI <1,500), while only one of the omitted mergers took place in an unconcentrated market. 31 To provide the reader with a sense of how the mergers affected market concentration in the regions located close to the merging firms' stores, we have also calculated the level and change of the HHI in the region immediately surrounding each of the merging firms' stores (defined as a 6-mile circle centered at the location of a store owned by one of the two merging firms). By construction, this technique generates as many \"local markets\" as there are stores owned by the merging firms. The online Appendix Table 4 presents descriptive statistics of the empirical distributions of the level and change in market concentration corresponding to each of the 14 studied mergers. Qualitatively, market concentration measured at the CBSA level and within the region immediately surrounding the affected stores were quite similar (with a correlation coefficient of 0.92). The level of market concentration (HHI) in the smaller regions tends to be larger than in the CBSA because (in most cases) fewer independent firms operate within subregions of a CBSA. 32 Most studies that exploit geographic variation in how mergers affect pricing using an identification strategy similar to ours. Examples include studies of mergers in the airline industry (Borenstein, 1990;Kim & Singal 1993), banking (Prager & Hannan, 1998;Focarelli & Panetta, 2003), gasoline refining and distribution (Taylor & Hosken 2007;Simpson &Taylor 2008), andhospitals (Haas-Wilson &Garmon 2011;Tenn 2011). 33 To our knowledge, the synthetic control estimator has not been used to estimate the price impact of mergers. 34 We use the Stata code developed by Sergio Correia (reghdfe.ado) available at https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s457874.html (last visited September 23,2016). 35 For the larger mergers we have been able to identify the dates the transactions closed, for example, A&P's merger with Pathmark. For smaller mergers, such as the transfer of ownership of a handful of stores in a small CBSA, we have not been able to identify the precise date the merger became effective. 36 Two of the mergers (in Evansville and Topeka) were consummated in the first half of 2008. For these transactions, we assume the effects of the merger are felt within 6 months. That is, pricing observed in 2009 represents how prices changed as the result of the merger. model. 50 The postmerger HHI is equal to the sum of the premerger HHI and the change in HHI shown in Table 1. 51 This can be more clearly seen in the figure in the appendix that plots the change in market concentration and the change in price (the analogue to Figure 2). 52 We have also examined the relationship between the postmerger level of concentration or change in concentration using alternative measures of market concentration, (e.g., market concentration measured within either 3 or 6 miles of a store owned by the merging firms). In all cases, we find qualitatively similar results to those shown in Figure 2: both the level of postmerger concentration and the change in concentration are positively correlated with the change in postmerger prices. However, only the level of postmerger concentration is statistically related to postmerger prices (at either the 5 % or 10% significance level). The results from this analysis are shown in online Appendix Table 7. 53 Antitrust economists have developed a number of techniques to measure the intensity of competition between competing retailers beyond market concentration to help identify which retailing mergers are most likely to be problematic (see Hosken & Tenn [2016]for a recent survey). 54 In related work, Hosken, Olson, and Smith (2016) examine the efficacy of using market entry and exit studies to forecast the likely competitive impact of horizontal mergers. Implicitly, this methodological approach assumes that the price impact of entry (exit) is the reverse of (the same as) a horizontal merger. That is, the estimated reduction in market prices following entry would be roughly the same magnitude (but opposite in sign) as a horizontal merger of similar size. Hosken, Olson, and Smith evaluate this methodological approach by estimating the price impact of market entry and exit in the supermarket industry. They conclude that studies of market exit are unlikely to inform merger analysis (more often than not market exit is associated with reductions in market price). Their findings for entry studies are more promising. Although the authors find evidence that the price impact of entry is biased down (in absolute value), overall, significant market entry appears to lower market prices. Moreover, when the authors compare the estimated price impact of entry to the estimated price effects of mergers found in this study, they note that they are of a similar magnitude. For this reason, Hosken, Olson, and Smith conclude that well-executed entry studies can provide useful information to aid antitrust enforcers in identifying potentially anticompetitive mergers."

It obviates the need for making particular assumptions about the precise distributional form of the error term in the estimating equation, helps to overcome omitted variable bias, and is relatively robust in the presence of 43 Estimation of the models is carried out using 'xtabond2' developed for Stata by Roodman (2007). Although xtabond2 is mainly used for estimating dynamic models -that is, for which w in equation 9) includes single or multiple lags of the dependent variable -it is flexible enough to be employed for static specifications as well (Drukker, 2008). We employ (less efficient) one-step estimation procedures since under (more efficient) two-step estimation (which applies an estimated optimal weighting matrix to the firststep estimates and which means the right-hand side varies slightly across equations), adding-up conditions fail to precisely hold. One-step and two-step procedures yield qualitatively similar results regarding the main questions of interest in this study."

To determine the likely stage distribution among women with missing data on stage in each registry, we conducted multiple imputation using chained equations with the ice command in Stata 12, specifying an ordered logistic model (Nur et al, 2010; White et al, 2011). We imputed TNM stage I-IV and SEER SS2000. We first used logistic regression models to determine which variables significantly predicted the pattern of missingness or were associated with stage. These variables were included in the imputation models. In all models, we included vital status, the non-linear effect of the log cumulative excess hazard and the non-linear effect of age at diagnosis. Where necessary, we also included subsite, year of diagnosis and interactions between the log cumulative excess hazard and age, year and subsite. We ran each imputation model 15 times and combined the results under Rubin's rules (White et al, 2011)."

However, reported point estimates of parameters using bias-corrected FE (we employed Bruno, 2005 Stata routine) are almost the same as the FE estimates, which suggest that the Nickell bias seems negligible in our context (and that OLS estimates suffer from omitted variable bias). Also the significance of country dummies suggests that OLS estimates may not be the most reliable ones. Finally, it should be noted that the FE estimates have a relatively small variance, especially if compared to consistent estimators as GMM (M\u00e1ty\u00e1s and Sevestre, 2008) or bias-corrected FE. For these reasons, we choose the simple FE estimator as the preferred one. Regarding the specification tests, the Arellano-Bond test for autocorrelation shows that including the lagged dependent variable and year dummies reduces problems with autocorrelation. At no reasonable significance level, the null hypothesis (i.e. that there is no autocorrelation) should be rejected. To deal with heterogeneity we use robust SEs."

For her first hour of work, her marginal tax rate is 15 percent under the new law, compared with 16.2 percent (.90 times 18 percent, due to the ten percent two-earner deduction) under the old law. The two earner deduction influenced marginal work incentives for most couples. TAXSIM shows that only 6.1 percent of two-earner couples would have incomes in 1988 that caused the $3000 deduction constraint to bind. The average married woman's marginal tax rate at part-time work, twenty hours per week, decreases from 22.5 percent (.90 of 25 percent) to 15 percent because of the tax reform. This rate change is probably the major determinant of the increase in labor supply that we found. At full-time work, the average married woman faces a marginal rate of 28 percent, which is a slight reduction from her 29.7 percent rate (.90 times .33) under old law."

First, by lowering marginal tax rates on most assets, it shrinks the tax wedge between pre-tax and post-tax returns. Calculations with the TAXSIM model illustrate this effect. In 1988, the average marginal tax rate on interest income will be 21.7 percent, compared with 25.8 percent under the old law. The change in marginal tax rates on corporate dividends is even more pronounced, from 33.4 percent to 25.3 percent, although the net effect on the equity tax wedge is smaller because the capital gains tax rate is increased. 18 Some taxpayers receive larger marginal rate reductions, but as King and Leape (1985) show, these investors already hold lightly-taxed assets such as high-growth corporate stock and tax-exempt debt."

Using the bioinformatics tools on TargetScan (Targetscan. org) [22-24], we predicted targets for each microRNA from the top 500 correlates of Rpe65. One microRNA, Mir666, did not appear on the TargetScan website. The remaining four microRNAs appeared on the website. When the microRNAs were scanned for targets, Mir98 had 29 targets in the RPE signature, Mir449a had 14 targets, Mir301b had 13 targets, and Mir28b had one target. This type of analysis may be one approach to constructing and understanding microarray networks within a specific cell type such as the mouse RPE."

In its place, we will develop an aggregation service that integrates microRNA target predictions from all the popular target prediction sites [for example, TargetScan (19), PicTar (20), microCosm, DIANA-microT (21), microrna.org (22)], together with lists of validated microRNA target sites [currently curated by resources such as TarBase (23), miRecords (24), miRTarBase]. This will initially involve displaying the top hits from each algorithm on existing miRBase sequence pages. In the longer term, an interface to search for hits from the aggregated algorithms will be developed, and consensus predictions from subsets of the algorithms will be provided. All results will link to the original data sources. To eliminate any long-term curation burden, we will accept depositions of microRNA target predictions and validated targets from users and target prediction groups."

We have developed an interface to view reads from RNA deep-sequencing data mapped to microRNA loci on the miRBase web site. Briefly, we identify entries in the Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih .gov/geo/) with short-read data that map to references discovering novel microRNAs. We extract the read sequences and counts from the GEO entry and map the reads to the set of miRBase hairpin sequences for a given organism using Bowtie (6) allowing at most two mismatches between the read and the hairpin sequence. The first deep-sequencing data sets incorporated into miRBase are from human, Drosophila melanogaster, Arabidopsis thaliana, rice and three nematode genomes. Additional data sets will be added rapidly. Ideally, all microRNA sequences submitted to miRBase will be linked to GEO submissions, or followed by the submission of the deep-sequencing data for inclusion in miRBase. The view of deep-sequencing data can be accessed from miRBase stem-loop and mature pages (Figure 2). Reads can be filtered by the number of mismatches to the hairpin sequence, the read count and by experiment. Each experiment is annotated with species, tissue, stage and methodology information. These tags enable the user to search for experiments by tissue expression on the miRBase search page (http://www.mirbase.org/search.shtml). Read counts for mature microRNAs are commonly used as a proxy for relative expression levels. As the number of deepsequencing experiments increases, these data provide extensive information about the expression profiles of microRNAs across tissues, stages and organisms. A good example of the power of these data can be seen in the small RNA data made available through the MODENCODE project for D. melanogaster (7). The patterns of read mappings also provide valuable evidence for relative abundance of mature sequences from different arms, for isoforms of mature microRNA sequences, and for the confidence in a given microRNA annotation. For example, Figure 2 shows a number of isoforms of mature microRNAs derived from both arms of the dme-mir-317 hairpin precursor. The dominant mature sequence from the 3 0 -arm is 21 nt in length, whereas the mature sequence annotated in miRBase 16 is extended to 24 nt. The 5 0 -mature sequence is unannotated in miRBase 16. The miRBase view of read data therefore provides the user with a clear picture of the profile of short RNAs generated from a microRNA locus, and facilitates the correction of errors and omissions in future releases."

In case of OsSOS genes, we found that OsSOS2 and OsSOS3 were expressed in diurnal manner. Diurnal rhythms of these two genes have a characteristic waveform, described by peaks and troughs. OsSOS3, with a phase of 24 h show higher expression level during night. Its expression shoots up in night and goes down during day, creating rhythmicity (Fig. 1B). Similarly, the transcript of OsSOS2 also shows a clear oscillation profile. MRNA levels of OsSOS2 cycles in lightdark periods, showing higher expression around the transition period of light to dark with a period of 24 h (Fig. 1C). The amplitude of OsSOS2 diurnal expression was higher in comparison to that of OsSOS3. mRNA level of OsSOS1 transcript fluctuates profiles in sos1, sos2 and sos3 mutants implicating this as transcriptional output requiring all components of the SOS pathway. 39 Expression of CCR1 as well as its homolog CCR2 is regulated by diurnal rhythm. 40 Not only downstream genes of SOS pathway, but also the interacting partners of SOS pathway show the diurnal rhythm. It has been reported that SOS2 interacts with catalase 2 (CAT2) and catalase 3 (CAT3) connecting SOS2 to H 2 O 2 metabolism and signaling. Expression of CAT2 is under circadian control, with the highest expression during the light period, consistent with a primary role in detoxifying H 2 O 2 derived from photosynthesis or photorespiration. 41 Interestingly, CAT3 is also circadian regulated, but in the opposite manner as CAT2. CAT3 between diurnal rhythm of SOS pathway genes and salinity stress tolerance. In Arabidopsis, elimination of SOS1 leads to the changes in expression of genes related to circadian rhythm. 38 It suggests that though SOS1 does not show any diurnal rhythm but it regulates diurnal rhythm of several other genes. It also indicates toward unknown and unexplored connection between SOS pathway and circadian clock."

In addition, 75-bp paired-end transcriptome sequence reads were produced for the tumors (Table 4). Sequence reads from the whole-genome libraries were aligned to the human reference genome (build GRCh37) using the Burrows-Wheeler alignment (BWA) tool (Li and Durbin 2010). The tumor's genomic sequence was compared with that of the patient's constitutive DNA to identify somatic alterations. Regions of copy-number variation and LOH were determined using hidden Markov model-based approaches HMMcopy and APOLLOH (Ha et al. 2012), respectively. De novo assembly and annotation of genomic data using ABySS and Trans-ABySS (Simpson et al. 2009) were used to identify small insertions and deletions (indels) and large structural variants (SVs) including translocations, inversion, and duplications leading to gene fusions; identified SVs were verified using an orthogonal alignment-based detection tool, BreakDancer (Chen et al. 2009). Single-nucleotide variants and indels in the tumor/ normal pair were identified using a probabilistic joint variant calling approach utilizing SAMtools and Strelka (Li et al. 2009;Saunders et al. 2012). Sequence reads from the transcriptome libraries were aligned to the human reference genome (build GRCh37) using TopHat (Kim et al. 2013) with Ensembl gene model annotation file on the -G parameter. The reference sequence and the corresponding annotation files were provided by Illumina's iGenome project and downloaded from the TopHat homepage (http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/ index.shtml). Structural variants were identified using a de novo assembly-based approach using ABySS and Trans-ABySS (Simpson et al. 2009) and the alignment-based SV detection tool MOJO (Minimum Overlap Junction Optimizer; https://github.com/cband/MOJO)."

The 76-bp long sequencing reads were checked for starting exactly with the barcode (4 bp) followed by the adapter sequence (23 bp for SB, 24 bp for PB and 22-bp for Tol2). The adapter for SB ended with 'TA' and the adapter for PB with 'TTAA' indicating transposase-mediated transposition events as opposed to random integration. The remaining parts of the reads (between 48 and 50 bp) were mapped using Bowtie (62) to the chromosomes of the human genome (NCBI built GRCh37/hg19, February 2009) excluding the Y-chromosome because HeLa is a female cell line. Only reads occurring without mismatches at a single genomic position (exact uniquely mapped reads) were used for the subsequent analysis. Multiple reads mapping to the same genomic position and strand were treated as a single integration site. To improve the data quality, we discarded all sites supported by <10 reads.

The data were integrated and scaled using XDS (35). The crystals belonged to space group P2 1 22 1 with the unit cell dimensions a \u03ed 35.7 \u00c5, b \u03ed 42.7 \u00c5, and c \u03ed 95.1 \u00c5. The phases and electron density map were obtained by molecular replacement using Phaser running in the CCP4 program interface with one complex in the asymmetric unit. Refinement was done using COOT (36) and REFMAC5 (37). Well defined electron density was obtained for GLP-1 residues Thr 11 *-Val 33 * and for ECD residues Val 30 -Glu 128 . Poor density was observed for GLP-1 residues Gly 10 *, Lys 34 *, and Gly 35 * and ECD residues Thr 29 and Asn 115 . No electron density was observed for His 7 *-Glu 9 * and Arg 36 *-Gly 37 * of GLP-1. Our final structure contains GLP-1 residues Gly 10 *-Gly 35 * and ECD residues Thr 29 -Glu 128 , but it should be noted that the conformation of Lys 34 * of GLP-1 is very uncertain, and because of the poor density we have chosen to show Asn 115 as Gly. The final GLP-1-bound ECD structure has 116 residues in preferred regions, 5 in allowed regions and only 1 outlier (Glu 68 in the \u2424-turn between \u2424 1 and \u2424 2 shown in Fig. 1A) in the Ramachandran plot. The structure containing 73 water molecules and a detergent molecule (n-decyl-\u2424-D-thiomaltoside) has a working R-factor of 0.181% and a free R-factor of 0.226%. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Coordinates and structure factors are deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 3IOL. Molecular graphics were prepared in PyMOL (46)."

The crystals obtained with Sgf11 (residues 7-33) diffracted isotropically to a resolution of 2.11 \u00c5, whereas those using residues 1-33 gave very anisotropic diffraction extending to 2.4 \u00c5 resolution along the c axis, but to only 2.7 \u00c5 resolution along the a and b axes. Molecular replacement using residues 21-90 of Sus1 from the Sac3-Sus1-Cdc31 complex (10) in PHASER (CCP4) gave a solution for four chains in the asymmetric unit of the Sgf11-(7-33)-Sus1 crystals, which was then refined using twinned refinement option in PHENIX (37) employing the twinning operator (h, -h-k, -l) and with R free flags set appropriately. Alternating cycles of refinement and rebuilding in COOT generated a model with an R-factor of 19.0% (R free \u03ed 23.7%), excellent geometry (Table 1) and a Mol-Probity score of 1.41 (99th percentile). Because of the presence of merohedral symmetry, stringent geometric constraints were applied, and these were then optimized to minimize the R free value during refinement. TLS parameters were obtained from the TLS website (38). The model obtained for the Sgf11-(7-33)-Sus1 crystals was then used to solve the Sgf11-(1-33)-Sus1 crystals using molecular replacement, which, after iterative cycles of refinement and rebuilding, gave a model with an R-factor of 21.3% (R free \u03ed 25.3%) and excellent geometry (Table 1)."

Micrographs were corrected for the phase reversals of the contrast transfer function using SPIDER 48 and binned to 3.26 \u00c5 per pixel before particles (straight segments of the rod-like structures) were manually picked in Boxer 49 and extracted into 80 by 80 pixel boxes. The particles were filtered between 100 and 10 \u00c5 and normalized using IMAGIC 50 . Particles were initially aligned to a vertical rectangle and the aligned images were then classified using multivariate statistical analysis (MSA) into classes containing on average 25 images. Classes were manually inspected and ones showing the highest similarity between the individual particles and their corresponding class average were selected for multi-reference alignment (MRA). Following two rounds of MRA/MSA, 3D reconstructions were calculated from the class averages showing the clearest features, using helical symmetry in SPIDER. The helical pitch repeat was estimated by helically averaging the clearest tomogram reconstruction over a range of repeat values and cross-correlating the resulting averages with the unaveraged tomographic reconstruction in CHIMERA. This comparison gave a clear optimum for the helical repeat, at 7.8 nm, and this value was used for helical reconstruction of the single particle class averages. Models from six different class averages, containing a total of 155 segments, were averaged in CHIMERA. As it was not possible to determine a subunit repeat from diffraction patterns of the negatively stained images, probably due to the flexible nature of the helical oligomer, the 3D maps were reconstructed with a subunit repeat of 1 pixel (3.3 \u00c5) to generate continuous helices.

A stainless steel microelectrode (FHC, Bowdoin, USA) was used to stimulate Schaffer collateral fibres, and extracellular field EPSPs were recorded from stratum radiatum of CA1 using a glass microelectrode. EPSPs were recorded using an Axopatch 1D in tandem with a Digidata 1440A digitiser (Axon Instruments). Data were collected using pClamp 10 software and analysed using Clampfit 10.2 (Molecular Devices). For all experiments, test stimuli were given once every 30 s (0.033 Hz), and the stimulus intensity was set to give a baseline fEPSP of 40-50% of the maximal response. A baseline was recorded for at least 20 min before application of Ab. In experiments using differentially aggregated Ab (stock solutions were diluted 1:200 into ACSF to produce nominal concentrations of 500 nM based on the starting weight of Ab 1-42 monomer), the sample was added to the perfusate 30 min before induction of LTP. LTP was induced by theta burst stimulation (10 bursts of 4 stimuli at 100 Hz, with an interburst interval of 200 ms) given at baseline intensity. The ACSF was recycled using peristaltic pumps (101 U/R, Watson-Marlow, UK) ensuring that the Ab was present for the duration of the experiment. LTP is expressed as the mean\u00b1s.e.m. % of baseline fEPSP slope. Statistical comparisons used analysis of variance with post hoc Tukey-Kramer test or unpaired Student's t-test where appropriate."

After separation of proteins, the gel was washed twice with washing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 2.5% triton X-100) and then treated with incubation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl at PH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl 2 , and 0.02% NaN 3 ) at 37 \u00b0C for 24 hr. After incubation, the gels were stained (0.5% coomassie blue, 10% metanol, and 5% acetic acid) and then destained (20% methanol and 10% acetic acid). MMPs were detected as a clear zone on the blue background. The gels were scanned using a densitometer (Bio-Rad GS-800) and the density of the bands was measured using Image J software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) (22)(23)(24)."

The following mouse antihuman monoclonal antibodies were used: intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) (cluster of differentiation [CD]54-PE; eBioscience, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA); vascular CAM-1 (VCAM-1) (CD106 fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer 1; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA); E-selectin (CD62E-APC; BD Biosciences); and vWF (BD Biosciences). Subsequently, HUVECs were collected and labeled with the abovementioned specific antibodies at room temperature for 45 minutes in the dark, washed extensively, and then subsequently fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde. All samples were analyzed using a FACScan\u2122 flow cytometer (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The data were analyzed with CellQuest\u2122 software (BD Biosciences)."

Eight loci were amplified and sequenced-seven International Society for Human and Animal Mycology (ISHAM) consensus loci CAP59, GPD1, IGS1, LAC1, PLB1, SOD1, and URA5 (23) and the optional highly polymorphic TEF1 locus ( 24). An additional LAC1Ra primer was developed to replace the consensus primer, which was not sufficiently specific for LAC1 amplification in our samples. All primers are listed in Table S2 in the supplemental material. MLST PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, excised, purified, and sequenced. Sequence assembly was performed with Sequencher 4.9 software (Genecodes, Ann Arbor, MI). Exported sequences were truncated to the consensus MLST ends (23). Sequences for each locus were aligned using ClustalW software (66). All polymorphisms were verified using the sequence chromatograms, and alignments were manually edited to resolve ambiguities. Multiple alignments were processed with PAUP4.0b10 software (Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA) to produce maximum parsimony trees using a heuristic algorithm with 1,000 random sequence additions and gaps treated as the fifth base. A total of 4,430 characters were analyzed: 4,315 characters were constant, 71 variable characters were parsimony uninformative, and 44 characters were parsimony informative. Sequences for all loci for each UgCl sample were concatenated and subjected to maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and bootstrap analyses using PAUP4.0b10 software. Nonredundant allelic sets were compiled using the Non-redundant databases (NRDB) web tool (http://pubmlst.org).

In assays with the API ZYM and rapid ID 32A systems, esterase (C4), esterase lipase (C8), leucine arylamidase, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase, \u03b1-glucosidase, N-acetyl-\u03b2-glucosaminidase, \u03b2-galactosidase-6phosphate, arginine arylamidase, proline arylamidase, leucyl glycine arylamidase, phenylalanine arylamidase, pyroglutamic acid arylamidase, tyrosine arylamidase, alanine arylamidase, glycine arylamidase, histidine arylamidase, histidine arylamidase, serine arylamidase were present, but valine arylamidase, lipase (C14), cystine arylamidase, trypsin, \u03b1-chymotrypsin, \u03b2galactosidase, \u03b1-galactosidase, \u03b2-glucuronidase, \u03b2-glucosidase, \u03b1-mannosidase, \u03b1-fucosidase, \u03b2-arabinosidase and glutamyl glutamic acid arylamidase were not detected. The antibiotic sensitivity test was conducted via the disk diffusion method (Roy Chowdhury et al., 2007). The CH4 isolate evidenced susceptibilities to ampicillin (100 mg/ ml), nalidixic acid (15 mg/ml), kanamycin (50 mg/ml), streptomycin (50 mg/ml), tetracycline (15 mg/ml), gentamycin (30 mg/ml), chloramphenicol (30 mg/ml), rifampicin (50 mg/ml), neomycin (15 mg/ml), but was resistant to cephalothin (50 mg/ml). For fatty acid methyl ester analysis, cells were harvested from trypticase soy agar (TSA; Difco) plates after 2 days of incubation at 30 o C. The fatty acids were extracted and fatty acid methyl esters were prepared in accordance with the standard protocols of the MIDI Hewlett-Packard Microbial Identification System (Sasser, 1990). FAME analysis on cellular fatty acid compositions of the CH4 strain identified the isolate as E. americana with a 0.75 similarity index in the library database [the Microbial Identification System Library for aerobes (ver. 3.90)] (data not shown). The major fatty acid components of the examined CH4 strain were as follows: 16:0 (31.9%), 17:0cyclo (22.2%), 18:1w7c (11.8%) and sum in feature 2 (9.6%, comprising 14:3 OH/16:1 iso I). Sequencing and assembly of the 16S rRNA gene were conducted as previously described (Lane, 1991). The resultant 16S rRNA gene sequence (1392nt) of the CH4 strain was compared with the 16S rRNA gene sequences available from GenBank, using the BLAST program to determine an approximate phylogenetic affiliation, after which the gene sequence was multiply aligned with those of closely related species using the MEGALIGN program (DNASTAR). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method (Saitou and Nei, 1987) with the MEGA3.1 program (Kumar et al., 2004); bootstrap percentages were based on 1000 replications (Felsenstein, 1985). This strain evidenced 99% 16S rRNA sequence similarity with E. americana, according to our BLAST search for homologous sequences (GenBank accession No. EU678360). Fig. 2 shows the inferred phylogenetic relationships derived from a neighbor-joining analysis among the 16S rRNA gene sequences of CH4 isolates from this survey with 17 validly described Enterobacteriaceae species. The CH4 isolates from this study were most closely related to E. americana (Fig. 3)."

Second, to discard irrelevant studies, two authors (L.G. and M.-C.B.) screened all titles identified through the electronic databases search. Third, to select studies that met our inclusion criteria from the remaining articles, L.G. and M.-C.B. read abstracts and full texts using a study selection form built specifically for this purpose. If the results of a study were reported in more than one publication, only the publication with the most complete results was retained. Only if publications on the same study focused on different outcomes or different populations did we include them. To avoid double counting data from multiple publications, we juxtaposed author names, sample sizes, and outcomes. Using k statistics, we assessed interreviewer agreement on the selection process steps: for title evaluation ( If consensus could not be reached, L.G. made the final decision. The following information was extracted from each study article: author names, year of publication, study design, country, period of data collection, description of participants, age, and data on diabetes assessment (type of diabetes, data collection, and method). In addition, we extracted the following details for each study article: number of individuals with and without diabetes, type of outcome (definition and data collection and assessment methods), statistical analysis, number of days lost per year, percentage of individuals with the outcome, number of years retired earlier, and summary measure of dependent variable effect with 95% CI or P value. In the included studies different units of time (week, month, or year) were used to report data on the productivity outcomes. In consequence we calculated, when necessary, the number of days lost per year to allow comparison between studies. When data on the number of hours worked per week and the number of weeks worked per year were missing, we assumed that individuals were working 40 h per week and 50 weeks a year. Whenever more than one summary measure was reported for an outcome, the most adjusted (summary measure from the model including highest number of variables) was considered. Crude relative risks were calculated each time the effect size was not reported, provided the article supplied sufficient information. Missing information was obtained by contacting corresponding authors and consulting survey web sites. We did not impute missing data. They also assessed the quality of casecontrol studies using the NOS for casecontrol studies (27). Both scales address three domains: 1) selection of study groups (four items for case-control studies and three items for cohort studies [we removed one item for cohort studiesd\"demonstration that outcome of interest was not present at start of study\"dbecause it was irrelevant to our outcomes]), 2) comparability of these groups (one item), and 3) ascertainment of either exposure or outcome of interest (three items). A study could be awarded a maximum of one star for each item within the selection and outcome categories and a maximum of two stars for comparability. The overall quality rating was the sum of the stars (maximum of eight stars for cohort and nine for casecontrol studies, respectively). To evaluate the quality of cross-sectional studies, we modified the NOS for cohort studies. In the selection and outcome sections, three of the nine itemsd\"demonstration that outcome of interest was not present at start of study,\" \"was follow-up long enough for outcomes to occur?\" and \"adequacy of follow-up\"dwere removed since they are not applicable to cross-sectional studies. Thus a maximum of six stars could be awarded. We regarded a study as having a low risk of bias if it was allocated the maximum number of stars for its design. "

In the past two decades, many new methods for finding distinctive features of protein coding regions have been presented, including the algorithms based on codon usage (1 ), dicodon usage (2 ), 3-base periodicity (3)(4)(5), and the fifth-order phase Markov chain model (6 ).

Moreover, it needs a large data set to train the bulky parameters, whose number is nearly five thousand.

The second one is the new manner of production demonstrated through the development of so-called digital commons such as Wikipedia and open source software. Just like the compilation of encyclopaedic knowledge in Wikipedia, open source software is originally programmed by volunteers who do the work because they enjoy what they are doing and find it useful. A distinctive feature of open source as compared to conventional software production is that in the latter case all the program code, the core of the respective products, is kept secret and unchangeable for users, while in the former case it is freely accessible for everybody. People can download the programs, use them, and improve them. In many cases this is associated with a copyleft license 2 (e.g. GNU General Public License or some of the Creative Commons licenses) that allows these activities only as long as what comes out of that process remains freely accessible. The advantage of such licenses is that they can ensure that the modifications and extensions that are made will remain free. Using copyright legislation, they protect the licensed products against enclosure attempts. This allowed well accepted and widely used free web browsers such as Firefox, free office packages such as Libre Office, and even free operating systems (Linux) to be created, improved, and distributed. This is particularly interesting since software is not only a pure consumption good but also a means of production that has become increasingly crucial for many production processes. This (slightly misleadingly dubbed) immaterial production is supplemented more and more by material production projects such as Open Source Ecology (OSE). OSE develops and tests the \"Global Village Construction Set,\" a set of (the presumably most important) tools and machines that will serve the population of an entire village to sustain themselves and live a good life with 1 The official name is \"Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.\" 2 Copyleft describes the act of using copyright legislation in order to make works freely available to the general public.

The construction plans are freely accessible and the products are designed and constructed around modularity, reparability, reducing pollution, and the sparing use of natural resources. 3 This is in sharp contrast to conventional constructions (and knowledge management) that mainly focus on profitability."

This happened, for example, when some people from the office software project \"Open Office\" were not happy about some decisions taken in the development and communication processes. They founded the counterpart \"Libre Office\" and in doing so forked the project \"Open Office.\" Knowing about the differences between the projects, people can freely decide which project they want to join and which product to use. 16 That gives great incentives for maintainers to take decisions that are supported by the people using the products, and to an even larger extent to take decisions supported by the contributors. One could call this \"structural focus on stakeholders\" as opposed to shareholders. 17 On free software projects it is quite common to rely on maintainers to take a relevant degree of decisions. This has proven pragmatic and not necessarily authoritarian. People can \"fork,\" they are not dependent on the jobs they are doing, so there is no functional drive for authority to become authoritarian. This maintainer authority is mainly based on reputation, initiative, voluntariness, and practical knowledge and acts instead of structural and personal power (cf. Siefkes 2009). Additionally, needs orientation is a basic underlying principle of peer production. As there is no direct exchange, the structurally antagonistic interests of producers and consumers disappear. Producers do not become active through some abstract value (money/profit) or mere force, but rather through their own (intrinsic) motivations 18 to do the tasks that are needed, which of course is enhanced if people actually need and thus appreciate the products. The distinct separation of paid and unpaid activities (often described as production and reproduction labor) is a fundamental building block of the capitalist method of production. Ideally, this is not the case with commons production as the abstract evaluation mechanism is absent, and there is no money or another equivalent involved. 19 It is about contributing voluntarily, and taking what is needed, not on (equivalent) exchange relations. Hence, an equivalent is neither needed nor functional. 20 Furthermore, production and reproduction cannot be said to be separated into different spheres as the production process becomes needs-oriented and ceases being profit-oriented. Thus, we can say that commons are not only based on both production and reproduction, but also that the distinction might even vanish and a transcendence of the two take place. We could name this new category (re)production (cf. L\u00f6schmann 2013)."

They founded the counterpart \"Libre Office\" and in doing so forked the project \"Open Office.\" Knowing about the differences between the projects, people can freely decide which project they want to join and which product to use. 16 That gives great incentives for maintainers to take decisions that are supported by the people using the products, and to an even larger extent to take decisions supported by the contributors. One could call this \"structural focus on stakeholders\" as opposed to shareholders. 17 On free software projects it is quite common to rely on maintainers to take a relevant degree of decisions. This has proven pragmatic and not necessarily authoritarian. People can \"fork,\" they are not dependent on the jobs they are doing, so there is no functional drive for authority to become authoritarian. This maintainer authority is mainly based on reputation, initiative, voluntariness, and practical knowledge and acts instead of structural and personal power (cf. Siefkes 2009). Additionally, needs orientation is a basic underlying principle of peer production. As there is no direct exchange, the structurally antagonistic interests of producers and consumers disappear. Producers do not become active through some abstract value (money/profit) or mere force, but rather through their own (intrinsic) motivations 18 to do the tasks that are needed, which of course is enhanced if people actually need and thus appreciate the products. The distinct separation of paid and unpaid activities (often described as production and reproduction labor) is a fundamental building block of the capitalist method of production. Ideally, this is not the case with commons production as the abstract evaluation mechanism is absent, and there is no money or another equivalent involved. 19 It is about contributing voluntarily, and taking what is needed, not on (equivalent) exchange relations. Hence, an equivalent is neither needed nor functional. 20 Furthermore, production and reproduction cannot be said to be separated into different spheres as the production process becomes needs-oriented and ceases being profit-oriented. Thus, we can say that commons are not only based on both production and reproduction, but also that the distinction might even vanish and a transcendence of the two take place. We could name this new category (re)production (cf. L\u00f6schmann 2013)."

Because HCC mut or HCC WT cells express GFP, ROS measurements were performed in these cells using dihydroethidium (DHE; Sigma-Aldrich). Mean fluorescence values (FL-1 for DCF-DA or FL-2 for DHE) were displayed as bar graphs. In case of sorted luminal and MaSCs/basal pMECs, data were shown in the form of histogram overlays using the %Max option, which scaled each population curve to mode = 100% on the y axis and log10 FL-1 (DCF-DA) fluorescence intensity on the x axis."

Given the initial level of a transition rate (i.e., upon entry into the state under consideration), the shape of this rate is described by the parameters of the duration dependence function (see the estimates in Table 4 and Fig. 2). Apart from these duration dependence parameters, the specifications only include time-invariant covariates. The rate into temporary work from unemployment is smaller than the rate into regular work. However, once an individual is in temporary employment, the rate 14 Strictly speaking we do not solve for initial conditions since we do not fully observe the previous employment history of all cases. 15 The estimates were computed with GAUSS, using the standard maximum likelihood application MAXLIK. The programming of the likelihood function was based on a range of available programs for the \"Timing of Events\" approach. The likelihood function of the base model was optimized in 265 iterations, using the Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb and Shanno (BFGS) optimization algorithm and a numerical gradient with a tolerance level of 10 \u22124 for the gradient of the estimated coefficients. Identical results were obtained using different numbers of individuals, a wide range of different starting values, and different optimization algorithms (like the Newton-Raphson method and the Berndt, Hall, Hall and Hausman method). of flowing into regular work is at some time after the start of the search larger than otherwise. One might expect workers who accept a temporary job to be initially strongly attached to that job-for example, for contractual reasons. This is true in some sense. Newly employed temporary workers have a slightly lower rate into regular work than unemployed workers. Until 1 year after the start of the temporary job, the transition rate to regular work is lower than the transition rate from unemployment to regular work. After a period of 1.5 years, however, the transition rate from temporary into regular employment increases substantially. This does not correspond to any binding legal restriction in the length of temporary work (see Section 2), as in e.g. Guell and Petrongolo (2007). After 30 months, we are left with only 225 observations in the data, which makes the estimated hazards, and the observed jumps in the transition rates, rather imprecise. The jumps in the hazard rates could be due to the loss of wage-related unemployment benefits for many of the unemployed."

The concentration of A549 cells was adjusted to 100,000 cells per 200 \u03bcL and loaded into the wells of microtiter E-plates (96 wells) after obtaining the background impedance of the plates. The cell background impedance was monitored every 5 minutes for the first 20 hours. The RPMI medium was removed before adding 200 \u03bcL of each ZnONP or Al-ZnONP sample, prepared in media at particle concentrations of 0, 20, 50, 150, 300, and 500 \u03bcg/mL. For the next 48 hours, cell impedance was monitored, and the electrical impedance was calculated using the RTCA-integrated software of the xCELLigence system. The electrical impedance was expressed as a dimensionless parameter, termed the cell index (cell-viability index)."

                    "full_context": "FIG. 1. Short-term HFD induces liver, but not adipose tissue insulin resistance. A: Liver insulin resistance was determined by impaired insulin-stimulated p-Akt on serine 473 after intravenous injection of insulin. Representative immunoblot of p-Akt in liver lysates from mice at day 0 up to day 28 on HFD compared with liver lysates of a mouse that was not treated with insulin (-). After densitometry analysis, the ratio of the intensity of the p-Akt band to total Akt (t-Akt) was calculated and presented, as arbitrary units, by the mean 6 SEM of 10 mice studied in three independent experiments. Superoxide generation. The production of the superoxide anion by intact neutrophils was measured as the superoxide dismutase inhibitable reduction of acetyl ferricytochrome c by the microtiter plate technique, as previously described (22). Cytokines and eicosanoids release measurements. Epididymal fat tissue from mice was removed, weighed, sliced, and incubated for 3 h in 1 mL medium containing 0.1% BSA. The collected media were measured using commercial ELISA kits for TNF-a (Biolegend, San Diego, CA), 15 mg tissue for each sample, MIP-2, KC, leukotriene B4 (LTB 4 ), IL-6 (all from R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN), 150 mg tissue for each sample. Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) levels were determined according to a dextran-coated charcoal radioimmunoassay protocol, using PGE 2 standard, anti-PGE 2 anti-serum (Sigma Israel, Rehovot, Israel), and [ 3 H]PGE 2 (Amersham Biosciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ), exactly as previously described (23). Pyruvate tolerance test. Pyruvate tolerance test was performed by intraperitoneal injection of pyruvate (2 g/kg body weight) in saline after an overnight fast. Blood glucose concentrations were measured in tail blood before and after injection at the times indicated (24). All glucose measurements were made using a glucometer (Abbott, Alameda, CA). Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated by multiplying fasting plasma insulin concentration (mU/L) with fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) divided by 22.5 (25)(26)(27). Plasma insulin levels were determined by ELISA (ALPCO Diagnostics, Salem, NH). Glucose clamp studies. Glucose clamp studies in freely moving mice were performed as described (28). Steady-state glucose infusion rate was calculated once glucose infusion reached a near-constant rate to maintain glucose at 5 mmol/L for 20 min. The glucose disposal rate was calculated by dividing the rate of [3-3 H]glucose infusion by the plasma [3-3 H]glucose-specific activity (29,30). Endogenous glucose production during the clamp was calculated by subtracting the glucose infusion rate from the glucose disposal rate (29,30). Insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rate was calculated by subtracting basal endogenous glucose production (equal to basal glucose disposal rate) from the glucose disposal rate during the clamp (31). Statistical analysis. Data are presented as the mean 6 SEM. Statistical significance for comparison between two groups was determined using the Student paired two-tailed t test, and by ANOVA for more than two treatment groups, followed by Bonferroni correction or by Newman-Keuls post hoc test, using GraphPad Prism 5.03 software."

                    "full_context": "Male Wistar rats weighing 220 -240 g and male C57BL/6J mice weighing 20 -25 g were from Centre Elevage Janvier, Le Genest-St. Isle, France. The animals had free access to tap water and standard food and were treated in accordance with European Community guidelines concerning care and use of laboratory animals. Glucose tolerance test. Gavages of conscious rats or mice with 1 g of glucose per kilogram of body weight were performed after a 16-h fast using a D-glucose solution without (control) or with RELM-\u2424. The total bolus volume for mice and rats was 0.25 ml and 1 ml, respectively, and the amount of glucose in each bolus was adjusted for the animal weight. The recombinant murine RELM-\u2424 (18 kDa; PeproTech, Neuilly-sur-Seine, France) used was highly purified by high-performance liquid chromatography and was endotoxinfree. RELM-\u2424, at a final concentration of 0.1 and 1 nmol/l, results in dose range of 0.01-0.1 g/kg of body weight. RELM-\u2424 is a stable molecule as high amounts of the homodimer form have been detected in mice and human stools (21). Preliminary experiments showed that the peptide given by gavage was found in proximal small intestine after 5 min with a recovery of 70%. Before starting the OGTT, blood samples were taken from the tail and fasting blood glucose levels (milligram per deciliter) were determined (ACCU-CHEK; Roche Diagnostic, Meylan, France). The bleeds were further taken at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after oral glucose administration. These experiments were performed at least with 6 -10 individual animals. Tissue preparation and short-circuit measurement. Rats were fasted for 16 h and were killed by pentobarbital overdose. The proximal jejunum was dissected out and four adjacent samples were mounted in Ussing chambers as described previously (22). The tissues were bathed with 4 ml of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) solution (pH 7.4) with 10 mmol/l glucose at 37\u00b0C. In the solution bathing the mucosal side of the tissue, glucose was replaced by mannitol. Both solutions were gassed with 95% O 2 /5% CO 2 . Electrogenic ion transport was monitored continuously as short-circuit current (Isc) by using an automated voltage clamp apparatus (DVC 1000; WPI, Aston, England) linked through a MacLab 8 to a MacIntosh computer. KRB alone (vehicle) or containing RELM-\u2424 (0.001-1 nmol/l) was added in the mucosal bath 2 min before a glucose challenge. Carbachol (100 mmol/l) was added at the end of each experiment as a control. Further, similar tests were performed with RELM-\u2424 incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against RELM-\u2424. Results were expressed as the intensity of the Isc (A/cm 2 ) or as the percentage of the peak Isc obtained after glucose challenge (measured after 3 min) over basal Isc (measured just before the addition of glucose). Transmural transport of hexoses. The experiments were performed using jejunal sacs from adult Wistar rats. Animals were fasted for 16 h and were killed by pentobarbital overdose. The proximal jejunum was dissected out and rinsed in cold saline solution. Jejunal loops (4 cm long) were prepared and 0.5 ml of KRB solution without (control) or with 1 nmol/l RELM-\u2424 was inserted inside the jejunal lumen. The jejunal loops were incubated for 15 min in oxygenized KRB at 37\u00b0C and conditions were maintained during hexose transport assay. The corresponding jejunal loops were filled with 1 ml of KRB solution without (control) or with 1 nmol/l RELM-\u2424 and containing 0.02 Ci/ml of the isotopic tracer D-[1-14 C] glucose (49.5 mCi/mmol) and glucose to obtain a final concentration of 10, 30, and 100 mmol/l. Similarly, we studied the paracellular transport with 30 mmol/l mannitol and the isotopic tracer D-[1- 14 C] mannitol (59 mCi/mmol) at 0.2 Ci/ml. All the jejunal loops were incubated in 10 ml of KRB solution during the indicated time. The radioactivity was measured in the collected samples of serosal KRB solution and used to calculate glucose or mannitol transport as picomoles per milligram of jejunal protein. Five independent experiments were performed and significance is expressed as *P \u03fd 0.05,**P \u03fd 0.01. Western blot analysis. Rats were anesthetized by pentobarbital and laparotomized for in situ experiments. Three jejunal segments (5 cm long) were tied and filled with 3 ml of KRB without (control) or with 1 nmol/l RELM-\u2424. After 3 min of in situ incubation, 3 ml of 60 mmol/l glucose solution were injected in the lumen to obtain a final concentration of 30 mmol/l. After a further 3 min, these loops were removed and opened along the mesenteric border and the mucosa was scraped off on ice with a glass blade. Total cell protein extracts and BBMs were prepared from the scrapings as previously described ( 23), and enrichment was estimated by determination of alkaline phosphatase activity (20-fold increase of activity in BBMs). Solubilized proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblot analysis. The following rabbit antibodies were used at a 1:1,000 dilution: SGLT-1 (AB 1352; Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), GLUT2, PKC \u2424II (sc-9117, sc-210; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Tebu-Bio, France), phospho-AMPK-\u2423 (Thr172), AMPK-\u2423 (23A3), and phospho-PKC (pan (2531, 2603, 190D10; Cell Signaling Technology, Ozyme, France). The intensity of the specific immunoreactive bands was quantified using National Institutes of Health Image (Scion, Frederick, MD). Glucose uptake experiments. Uptake experiments were performed using rat intestinal everted rings as previously described (24). Groups of eight intestinal rings were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 min in oxygenized KRB buffer in the absence (control) and the presence of RELM-\u2424 (1 nmol/l) and cytochalasin B as indicated. Then the rings were incubated for 2 min in an uptake solution corresponding to a KRB buffer containing 30 mmol/l glucose and 0.1 Ci/ml of the isotopic tracer D-[1-14 C] glucose. After adding the uptake solution, the rings were washed in ice-cold KRB solution, and radioactivity incorporated in the tissue was quantified by liquid scintillation. Data were not corrected for extracellular substrate because RELM-\u2424 was found not to affect paracellular diffusion. Total protein from homogenized tissue with a Dounce homogenizer was determined with bicinchoninic acid reagent from Pierce (Thermo Scientific, Brebie `res, France). Results are expressed as micromoles glucose per gram of tissue protein. Chemicals. Recombinant murine RELM-\u2424 was purchased from PeproTech (Neuilly-sur-Seine, France). Antibody raised against RELM-\u2424 was a gift from Dr. Blagoy Blagoev (University of Southern Denmark). D-[1-14 C] Mannitol was from GE Healthcare Amersham Biosciences (les Ulis, France), D-[1-14 C] glucose was from Perkin Elmer (Boston, MA), and compound C from Merck Sharp & Dohme-Chibret (Paris, France). All other chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Statistical analysis. All results were expressed as means \u03ee SE. One-way ANOVA with Turkey-Kramer multiple comparisons post hoc test was performed using GraphPad Prism version 4.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The level of significance was set at P \u03fd 0.05."

Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a Dunns post-test. The multiple linear regression model was used to estimate multivariate factors which influence the iNKT cell numbers, including HBsAg levels, HBV-DNA values, HBeAg status, ALT, gender, and age. Comparisons between 2 groups were conducted using Mann-Whitney test. A Friedman test followed by a Dunns posttest was used to compare iNKT cell frequency before and after antiviral therapy. A P value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant."

Forty human maxillary canines with straight canals were prepared according to a crown-down technique and enlarged to a#30 apical file size, before obturation with gutta-percha and a zinc-oxide-eugenol based sealer. The samples were stored for 3 months before being randomly assigned to four groups: chloroform (n=10), orange oil (n=10), eucalyptol (n=10) and control (n=10). Solvents were applied to a reservoir created on the coronal root third using Gates Glidden drills. The total time for retreatment using the solvents was 5 minutes per tooth. Following retreatment the roots were split longitudinally for SEM evaluation. SEM images were digitized, analyzed using Image ProPlus 4.5 software, and the number of dentinal tubules free of filling material from the middle and apical thirds was recorded. No significant difference was found among the solvent groups regarding the number of dentinal tubules free of root filling remnants in the middle and apical root thirds (p>0.05). However, the control group had fewer dentinal tubules free of filling material (p<0.05). Under the tested conditions, it may be concluded that there was no significant difference among the solvents used to obtain dentinal tubules free of filling material remnants."

Serial 5-\u03bcm-thick sections including the crestal areas mesial and distal to the maxillary molars were cut and mounted on L-poly-lysine-coated glass slides. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemistry was performed. For immunohistochemistry staining, endogenous peroxidase in the tissue section was blocked with 1% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes and then further blocked with 1% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 minutes. The primary antibody used was polyclonal rabbit anti-human ephrinB2. An immunohistochemistry staining kit (Maixin Bio, Fuzhou, China) was used for further staining. Finally, sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted. Negative controls were labeled using the same procedures, but omitting the incubation with primary antibodies.

After overnight culturing to allow cell recovery, the specific NO donor was added by freshly dissolving donor stock solutions into the culture media to 2X specific concentrations and gently adding equal volume of this 2X donor media solution to the volume of culturing media containing cells. Immediately before using all the NO donors, the concentration of the different NO donor stocks were determined by UV-vis spectrometry. Then culturing of cells continued for different durations, with a 24 h maximum time frame. Immediately after the designated treatment time ended, proliferating cells were labeled by using EdU imaging kit. In brief, DNA synthesis was labeled by EdU (5-ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine) incorporation, and this incorporation is visualized by alkyne-azide (EdU provides alkyne; Alexa Fluor s dye provides azide) reaction, which was performed after 3.7% formaldehyde fixation and 0.5% Triton X-100 permeabilization.

Material and Methods: Twentyseven Wistar rats were submitted to coronal opening of their mandibular right first molars. They were radiographed at 2, 15 and 30 days after the operative procedure by two digital radiographic storage phosphor plates (Digora \u00ae ). The images were analyzed by creating a region of interest at the periapical region of each tooth (ImageJ) and registering the corresponding pixel values. After the sacrifice, the specimens were submitted to microscopic analysis in order to confirm the pulpal and periapical status of the tooth. Results: There was significant statistically difference between the control and test sides in all the experimental periods regarding the pixel values (two-way ANOVA; p<0.05). Conclusions: The microscopic analysis proved that a periapical disease development occurred during the experimental periods with an evolution from pulpal necrosis to periapical bone resorption."

However, our previous results indicated that CycE activity could not prevent repression of E2F target genes after cell cycle exit in terminally differentiated eye and wing cells . Rbf-E2F2-mediated repression is somehow resistant to G1 cyclin-Cdks despite G1 cyclin-Cdk phosphorylation of Rbf (Frolov et al., 2003). This makes E2F2 complexes prime candidates as factors limiting CycE-dependent activation of E2F after cell cycle exit in differentiated cells. Genetic studies of E2F2 have failed to demonstrate a role for E2F2 in cell cycle exit upon differentiation in vivo (Frolov et al., 2001;Weng et al., 2003). e2f2 mutant cells exit from the wing and eye. Levels of GFP-E2F1 were determined by detection of the GFP tag using an anti-GFP antibody and compared between GFP-E2F1 WT and GFP-E2F1 PIP3A (Fig. 1, F-H). We found that levels of GFP-E2F1 PIP3A in the presence of CycE-Cdk2 after To test whether CycE-Cdk2 activity affected degradation of E2F1 after cell cycle exit in a PIP box-dependent manner, we generated clones coexpressing either WT GFP-E2F1 WT or E2F with a mutated PIP box, GFP-E2F1 PIP3A with CycE-Cdk2 in the Figure 1. Degradation of E2F1 activator complexes and a switch to E2F2 repressor complexes contributes to the CycE-Cdk2-resistant repression of E2F activity after exit. Clones overexpressing CycE-Cdk2 and negatively marked by CD2 (A and B) were generated using hs-FLP act>Gal4/UAS in e2f2 76Q1/G5.1 mutant wings. E2F transcriptional activity was monitored at the indicated stages using the PCNA-GFP reporter (A\ue039 and B\ue039). CycE-Cdk2 activity is temporarily able to activate the E2F reporter in the absence of e2f2 (A) but is unable to sustain E2F activity after 40 h APF (B). (C-E) GFP-marked e2f2-null mutant clones expressing CycE-Cdk2 were generated using the MARCM system and examined for ectopic mitoses by staining for PH3. Neurons are marked by expression of Elav. Ectopic mitoses in e2f2 \ue032/\ue032 cells expressing CycE-Cdk2 are evident in Elav-negative cells in eyes from 24 to 40 h APF (36 h APF shown; C) but are no longer observed by 44 h APF (D). No ectopic mitoses are observed in e2f2 \ue032/\ue032 cells expressing CycE-Cdk2 in wings after 36 h APF (E). (F-H) Clones expressing either GFP-E2F1 WT or GFP-E2F1 PIP3A with CycE-Cdk2 were generated using hs-FLP act>Gal4/UAS in pupal wings (F-H) and eyes (H). Clones were negatively marked by CD2 (F and G), and levels of GFP-tagged E2F1 were compared at 44 h APF. All GFP measurements were acquired at the same gain and at roughly similar tissue sections. Several samples (n = 7) across three independent experiments were compared for GFP intensity using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health), and representative examples are shown. Bars in H indicate the mean GFP intensity across all samples measured, and error bars indicate the standard deviation. GFP-E2F1 WT is destabilized in the presence of CycE-Cdk2 after exit in eyes and wings (F-H). Wings expressing either GFP-E2F1 WT or GFP-E2F1 PIP3A in the dorsal domain during pupal stages (under control of ap-Gal4/UAS, tub-Gal80 TS ) were assayed for PH3. (I and J) No ectopic mitoses were evident in wings expressing either the stabilized or WT forms of E2F1 after 36 h APF (44 h APF shown). However, several ectopic ELAV + neurons were found in the dorsal posterior margin of all GFP-E2F1 PIP3A -expressing wings (J, arrows).

LINE-1s were selected by blat using L1.2 sequence to http://genome.ucsc.edu and full-length intronic LINE-1s with the representative COBRALINE-1 CpG dinucleotides were selected. All selected LINE-1s are listed in Supplementary Table S1. After extraction, all DNA samples were treated with sodium bisulfite as previously described (4,31). Briefly, genomic DNA was denatured in 0.22 M NaOH for 10 min at 378C. Thirty microliters of 10 mM hydroquinone and 520 ml of 3 M sodium bisulfite were both added for 16-20 h at 508C. The DNA was purified and incubated in 0.33 M NaOH for 5 min at 258C, ethanol-precipitated, then washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in 20 ml of TE buffer. Two microliters of bisulfited DNA were subjected to 35 cycles of PCR with two primers, as listed in Supplementary Table S2, at an annealing temperature of 538C. The amplicons were digested in 30 ml reaction volumes with 2 U of TaqI or 8 U of TasI in 1 \u00c2 TaqI buffer (MBI Fermentas) overnight at 658C and then electrophoresed on 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The intensities of DNA fragments were measured on a PhosphoImager, using the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, GE Healthcare, Slough, UK). The TaqI positive methylated amplicons yielded 80-bp DNA fragments, whereas the TasI positive unmethylated amplicons resulted in 98-bp fragments (previously reported as 97 bp). The LINE-1 methylation level was calculated as a percentage (the intensity of the TaqI-digested methylated LINE-1 fragment divided by the sum of the TasI-digested unmethylated LINE-1 and TaqI-positive amplicons). For CU-L1, several other methylated and unmethylated digested amplicons, as listed in Supplementary Table S2, were also measured. The methylation levels among several CpG dinucleotides were compared. All COBRA assays were performed in duplicate. The same set of DNAs was applied as positive controls in each set of the COBRA experiments. The PCR products of some of the CU-L1 were cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Santhan, UK) and sequenced."

The XhoI and NotI restriction endonuclease sites incorporated into the sense and antisense primers above are shown in boldface. After PCR amplification, the amplicon was double digested with XhoI/ NotI for 2 hours following the manufacturer's protocol. The PCR product was subsequently subcloned into the XhoI/NotI sites downstream of the Renilla luciferase (r-luc) reporter gene (psiCHECK-2; Promega). The authenticity and orientation of the inserts relative to the Renilla luciferase gene were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. The resulting recombinant plasmids were designated psiCHECK/CDK6-UTR. Finally, transformed bacterial cultures were grown and each reporter construct was purified the PureLink Hipure Plasmid Maxiprep kit (Invitrogen)."

For a total number of G windows of size n c with \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 events per window, we must compute the criterion value a number of times that is roughly of the order Gn c (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 ). If we set N = 100,000, I = 50, G = 1000, n c = 100, and \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 = 5, we get that a nested algorithm requires NI = 5 \u00d7 10 6 calculations, whereas our method requires Gn c (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 ) = 5 \u00d7 10 5 calculations. In other words, our approach reduces computational requirements by an order of magnitude. In reality, because photobleaching is an exponential process, the vast majority of windows especially toward the end of the trace will have few or no events. Therefore Step 3 will either not need to be used or will have to discriminate between very few candidate models for those windows, so our approach is even faster than this upper bound. For typical photobleaching time traces with up to 10 3 data points, our algorithm works in seconds. For data sets that have between 1000 and 10,000 data points our algorithm runs in seconds to a few minutes. For very large data sets, our algorithm works faster than other methods we have tested. For example, in a test of a very large data set that was specifically designed to be hard to fit, performed on an ordinary MacBook Pro 2.5 GHz laptop, the Tdetector2 algorithm, which is based on Student's twosample t test as implemented in MATLAB by Chen et al.

For threedimensional reconstructions of the Texas-Red-dextran labeled cerebral vasculature, we intensity adjusted the z-stacks, Fourier filtered, and visualized them using maximum intensity projections. We restricted image analysis to averaging subsequent images with calculation of the mean and the s.d. for each pixel, and normalizing the 12-bit pixel intensities of the Fluoview1000 images to a continuous gray-intensity scale ranging from 0 to 1."

Each classifier is designed individually, i.e. uses different parameters and different set of input features (see Sections 2.5 and 2.6) computed from the IUPred, DISOclust and DISOPRED2 predictions, the sequence, the sequence profiles and the various relevant sequence-based predictions. The latter predictions are performed using methods chosen based on two criteria: (i) their quality is comparable to the leading relevant predictors; and (ii) they provide a stand-alone implementation that could be utilized to build an autonomous implementation of the proposed disorder predictor. We utilize PSIPRED (McGuffin et al., 2000) for the SS prediction, Real-SPINE3 for the prediction of the relative solvent accessibility (RSA) and backbone dihedral torsion angles (Faraggi et al., 2009), PROFbval for the B-factor prediction and residue flexibility prediction (Schlessinger et al., 2006) and RPSP for the signal peptide prediction (Plewczynski et al., 2008). We also use IUPred to predict globular domains. The selection of the SVM as the classifiers was motivated by its prior extensive use in disorder prediction (Hirose et al., 2007;Kinoshita 2007, 2008;Peng et al., 2006;Shimizu et al., 2007a, b;Vullo, et al. 2006). We use a linear-kernel-based SVM introduced in Fan et al. (2008). The real-valued prediction is computed as a maximum among the probabilities generated by SVM ALL , SVM SHORT and SVM LONG (we combine all predicted disordered residues) and the resulting value is binarized using the threshold that equals 0.37. The value of the threshold was found using the MxD dataset. We 'smooth out' our binary predictions by filtering out short segments (\u22642 residues). On the first pass, we convert predicted ordered residues in segments \u22642 residues to disordered residues with probability of 0.37. One the second pass, we reassign the short, \u22642 residues, segments of disordered residues as ordered with probability of 0.369. The MFDp predictor is shown in Figure 1."

Each classifier is designed individually, i.e. uses different parameters and different set of input features (see Sections 2.5 and 2.6) computed from the IUPred, DISOclust and DISOPRED2 predictions, the sequence, the sequence profiles and the various relevant sequence-based predictions. The latter predictions are performed using methods chosen based on two criteria: (i) their quality is comparable to the leading relevant predictors; and (ii) they provide a stand-alone implementation that could be utilized to build an autonomous implementation of the proposed disorder predictor. We utilize PSIPRED (McGuffin et al., 2000) for the SS prediction, Real-SPINE3 for the prediction of the relative solvent accessibility (RSA) and backbone dihedral torsion angles (Faraggi et al., 2009), PROFbval for the B-factor prediction and residue flexibility prediction (Schlessinger et al., 2006) and RPSP for the signal peptide prediction (Plewczynski et al., 2008). We also use IUPred to predict globular domains. The selection of the SVM as the classifiers was motivated by its prior extensive use in disorder prediction (Hirose et al., 2007;Kinoshita 2007, 2008;Peng et al., 2006;Shimizu et al., 2007a, b;Vullo, et al. 2006). We use a linear-kernel-based SVM introduced in Fan et al. (2008). The real-valued prediction is computed as a maximum among the probabilities generated by SVM ALL , SVM SHORT and SVM LONG (we combine all predicted disordered residues) and the resulting value is binarized using the threshold that equals 0.37. The value of the threshold was found using the MxD dataset. We 'smooth out' our binary predictions by filtering out short segments (\u22642 residues). On the first pass, we convert predicted ordered residues in segments \u22642 residues to disordered residues with probability of 0.37. One the second pass, we reassign the short, \u22642 residues, segments of disordered residues as ordered with probability of 0.369. The MFDp predictor is shown in Figure 1."

                    "full_context": "GO is a hierarchical graph-based annotation system where the terms closer to the root describe more general information while those away from the root provide more specific information about a given GO category. The root (level 0) describes three main GO categories at level 1, which are \"biological process\", \"molecular function\" and \"cellular component\". We used GO terms only from the \"biological process\" and \"molecular function\" categories because the data for the \"cellular component\" category are very sparse. Ideally, we would have used GO terms that provide specific descriptions on the processes or functions; however, the more specific the terms get, the less frequent they are, which prohibits meaningful comparison of GO term frequencies across different cancer. Hence, we chose the GO terms at level 4 for our analysis because at this level, GO terms are more specific (than those at previous levels), while generic enough to cover broader groups of related processes or functions to attain reasonable cumulative frequency for analysis. All the GO terms associated with a protein sequence were obtained from the GO database as graph paths, which have an inherent hierarchical order starting from the root (level 0). Since our goal is to compare the number of common GO terms across different cancer types, these GO terms must be selected at the same level in the graph path (for all cancers) to make the comparison meaningful. We developed a Perl program to store all the graph paths for a given protein. Using this program, under each GO category (except the \"cellular component\"), the common GO terms for a given pair of PPIs were determined at level 4 to calculate the frequency of common GO terms in a given cancer. Since the size of PPI dataset (Table 1) varies across different cancer types, frequencies of common GO terms were normalized against the number of PPIs, showing at least one common GO term in each cancer dataset. This normalization ensures a fair comparison of the common GO term frequencies across different cancer types irrespective of the size of PPI datasets used. The top 20 most frequent common terms were selected from each cancer, which were combined to obtain a nonredundant set of GO terms under the biological process and the molecular function categories, respectively."

Protein sequences in each of these databases are fairly overlapping, but are indexed by different identifiers such as SwissProt/UniProt identifier, GenBank protein identifier, etc, making it difficult to identify redundant sequences. To remove redundancy, we first created datasets of unique sequences (based on full-length protein sequence string comparison using Perl scripts) within each database and then merged them to create a non-redundant dataset of interacting protein sequences, each indexed with our internal identifier. Note that this internal identifier can be used to map all the original source identifiers for corresponding sequences in the source databases. Finally, we obtained 27,051 unique human protein sequences (henceforth referred to as P int ) representing 57,307 unique PPIs.

As noted in section 3, several authors have documented the sensitivity of the results from estimating unconstrained VARs to the assumptions about trends. At the same time, previous studies have virtually ignored the fact that the trends are determined both by the specification of the underlying uncertainty in the economy and the structure of the economic model itself. Therefore, 6. Standard errors of all variance decompositions reported in this paper were computed using the Monte Carlo procedure described in the RATS manual, page 17-3. Let b denote the estimated VAR coefficient vector and let V denote the estimated covariance matrix of the residuals in the VAR. Suppose that the VAR disturbances are i.i.d. and normally distributed. Then the posterior distribution of (b,V) is Normal-Wishart (see Zellner (1971)). Two hundred draws were taken from this distribution and the variance decomposition of the 48-month-ahead forecast error implied by each draw was calculated. The reported standard error is the square root of the sample variance of the estimated variance decompositions from the two hundred simulations."

Direct MTA targets could be of higher impact than the indirect signaling pathway in question. Oncogenes' alterations because of their impact on inducing cancer could be considered more deleterious than TSG alterations and consequently considered of higher impact in treatment algorithms. For example, when a tumor sample from a patient enrolled in a PM trial harbors an activating mutation of BRAF (V600E) and a homozygous deletion in PTEN, the inhibition of BRAF using vemurafenib should be considered of higher priority as compared with the use of an AKT or an mTOR inhibitor. An important criterion in prioritizing molecular alterations is also the presence of downstream resistance biomarkers. These data  review should be considered together with technical issues and thresholds (Table 5)."

Adding an indicator for home ownership did not improve the fit. 6. We thank two anonymous referees for making these points. Regarding the second point, the referee suggests distinguishing between homeowners who bought at or near the peak from those who bought much earlier. This is a very good idea that unfortunately does not work out. The HRS does contain data on respondent reported year of home purchase, but, less than 20 percent of the sample owned their 2006 home fewer than eight years and less than 12 percent owned it fewer than five years. 7. According to the Schwarz Criterion, this restriction works better than allowing the effect of home equity to vary over the Great Recession years. 8. The third specification is presented to demonstrate that our Great Recession equity variable does better than some alternatives. Deng, Quigley, and van Order (2000) use a negative equity specification. If the present value of future mortgage payments exceeds the value of the home, the household may default. For this to occur, the household will have to have bought the home shortly before 2007. Given the percentages in note 6, it is unlikely that a negative equity specification will produce significant results. 9. The observed significance level for the office worker result is .053."

The Random Parameter ROL model of the exploded data was estimated in STATA 13.0 based on the procedure in Hole (2007) using 500 Halton draws. The estimated parameters for the RPROL are presented in Table 4. Table 5 presents the parameter estimates for the RPROL of the proposed ranking mechanism restricted to observations ranked higher than the no-product option. 3 Although the pattern is not always monotonic, a similar trend as in the constant parameter models is observed with a reduction of the standard errors of the parameter estimates as the number of rankings increases. The standard deviations of the random parameters are highly significant showing the presence of unobserved taste heterogeneity in the choice variable. The predictive power of the traditional ranking method and the proposed heterogeneous ranking method show a similar pattern as the          The compliance test shows the proportion of the chosen alternatives with the highest predicted choice probability constant parameter models, with decreases for the middle ranks and an increase in the prediction accuracy when using the worst alternative in the full ranking (rank = 6) compared to middle ranks (ranks 4-5). The exploded BW ranking showed similar results as before with lower Tjur's R 2 than the models with the best two alternatives. The compliance test also showed higher predictions of the chosen alternative using the best and second-best alternatives compared to the BW. If data augmentation is used and individual preference heterogeneity is incorporated in a random parameter framework, then using the top two (best) rankings results in better predictions than the BW method. The stability of the parameters hypothesis was tested using Allison and Christakis (1994) framework, and it was also rejected for all partial rankings (rank = 2-rank = 5) and the full rankings (rank = 6). Results of these tests are also available in \"Appendix\" section."

We will instrument county-level unemployment rates with observable features in the labor market while leaving out the residuals including any unobserved components. Compared to the fixed-effects model, the IV approach allows us to keep using parts of the cross-county variation that are clearly driven by labor-market fluctuations. Specifically, we calculate the time series of likely employment losses 3. We switch to linear models in order to take advantage of STATA's built-in command to handle large dummyvariable sets (about 3000 counties in our case). The choice is also motivated by the incidental parameters problem that renders fixed effects probit models inconsistent. The choice of linear vs probit models makes little qualitative difference in SWB regressions, as documented in Ferrer-i- Carbonell and Frijters (2004). However, it does mean that the estimates in Tables S7 and S8 for the fixed effects models are not strictly comparable to those from the probit models. The income equivalents in Table 2, on the other hand, are comparable as they are expressed as income equivalents (or ratios of coefficients). Ratios of coefficients are robust to the choice of probit or linear models, because switching from one to the other tends to affect estimated coefficients proportionally (see Helliwell and Huang 2009). for individual counties based on their shares of employment by industry and external statewide employment losses by industry. We then use the contemporaneous and lagged likely losses to instrument for local unemployment rates in standard two-stage regressions. This approach leaves out unobserved local characteristics except for those that are correlated with local compositions of industries or with statewide loss of employment by industries, the only two pieces of information used in the IV approach. 4 We implement the IV approach using the industry classification at the level of 11 supersectors defined in the BLS. 5 The current likely loss and its 3-year lags, namely LikelyLossRate j,s,t \u2212 k for k = 0, 4, 8, 12, are then used as instruments in a two-stage least squares IV regressions. These likely employment losses are strong predictors of county-level unemployment rates: even without any co-variates, the likely losses explain 42% of the variation in the county-level unemployment rates since 2005."

First, we calculated the score based on the full sample with 477 observations. Then, the trimmed sample was employed, after eliminating countries that never participated in IMF programmes during the observed period. Table 2 shows the output of our regression, where pseudo R 2 for regression comprised 0.51, 0.52, and 0.31 for Models 1, 2, and 3. The third model represents regression based on the trimmed sample. The models precisely predict 71%, 74%, and 75% of IMF participation, respectively, based on calculated propensity scores. We use blockid in the specification to split the sample into blocks based on scores, which are 6 and 5, respectively, for the full and the trimmed samples. The balancing property was automatically run and has been satisfied, which means that in each of these blocks, not only the propensity scores were similar, but also the covariates on which we match. Before discussing the correlation of the obtained coefficients with our treatment variable, it must be noted that the common support option has been selected. The common support condition is valid, as countries with the same features cannot be observed in both the treated and the control group. The regions of common support are (0.012, 0.976) and (0.025, 0.961) for the full and the trimmed samples, respectively. Thus, the requirement on common support has been ensured, which, according to Heckman et al. (1997), is a major source of biased propensity score assessment. In order to check the overlap assumption, the distributions of propensity scores for full and trimmed samples have been plotted. It is revealed that there were no substantial differences between the distributions and that they were spread asymmetrically within the control and the treated groups. The slight inclination towards the rump in the trimmed sample illustrates that countries in the treatment group were more likely to resort to the IMF. To complete the checks, the kernel density of propensity scores has been estimated based on the Epanechnikov function with 0.023 bandwidth, where the graph revealed that the measured propensities, namely that an under-programme country would be under-programme and a non-programme country would not participate in IMF programmes, were in the area of coincidence."

To check whether fixed effects or random effects are suitable for our analysis, we perform the Hausman test, as suggested by Hoechle (2007), which takes into account the possibility of cross-sectional dependence in our data. This test is a slightly modified version of the panel-robust version of the Hausman test suggested by Wooldridge (2002, p. 288ff). Hoechle's (2007) adaptation of Wooldridge's (2002) test is robust to very general forms of spatial and temporal dependence in the residuals. In addition to the \"modified standard Hausman test,\" we also undertake two further tests, respectively a test for the presence of heteroskedasticity and one for serial correlation in the residuals. If the Hausman test rejects the random effects in favor of the fixed effects, and if our residuals are heteroskedastic and serially correlated, then we estimate model ( 1) with fixed effects by simultaneously taking into account the possibility of heteroskedasticity, serial correlation, and cross-sectional dependence in the residuals. In other words, we estimate a fixed-effects (within) regression model with Driscoll and Kraay [3] (1998) standard errors (henceforth referred to as FE-DK), which Hoechle (2007) adapted in Stata for unbalanced panels."

Parameters with a skewed distribution, such as PTX3, hs-CRP, tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin-6, and BNP levels, as well as E/e' and LVMI, are shown as median values (interquartile range) and were logarithmically transformed before linear regression analysis. Differences between continuous variables were analyzed by the unpaired t test and the Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate. Differences between categorical variables were analyzed by the chi-square test. Linear regression analysis was used to determine the associations between PTX3 and BNP levels, LVMI, inflammatory makers, and cardiovascular events. Survival data were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and assessed by the log-rank test. Age-and sex-adjusted event rates were calculated by multivariable logistic regression analyses. The ability of any marker to predict cardiovascular events was assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. In Cox proportional hazards regression analyses, associations between groups and all other parameters were first analyzed by univariate analysis followed by multivariable analysis after adjustment for factors that were significant with univariate analysis. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were also performed using forced inclusion models. Model 1 incorporated the inflammatory makers PTX3, hs-CRP, tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin-6, and BNP. Model 2 incorporated the 5 prognostic factors (PF5) that were identified during the I-PRESERVE study 10 in patients with HFNEF-age, presence of diabetes mellitus, previous hospitalization for HF, New York Heart Association classification, and LVEF-as well as BNP and PTX3. Model 3 incorporated PF5, BNP, and hs-CRP. Model 4 incorporated PF5, BNP, hs-CRP, and PTX3. Estimates of the C-statistic for Cox proportional hazards regression models were calculated. [18][19][20] Cstatistics were estimated after PTX3 and BNP levels were added to PF5. 10 The proportional hazards assumption was confirmed by the Schoenfeld global test. Calibration of Cox regression models was also performed by the Gr\u00f8nnesby and Borgan calibration test. 21 The incremental effects of addition of PTX3 to PF5 and BNP levels to predict future cardiovascular events were evaluated using the net classification index (NRI), as previously described. 22 Patients were stratified into 1 of 3 risk categories based on PF5 and BNP levels measured during the mean 30-month follow-up period: low risk (0% to <10%), intermediate risk (10% to 20%), or high risk (>20%). PTX3 was subsequently used to reclassify the risk category for ascertaining whether there would be improvement in the NRI. The NRI was calculated using the following equation: NRI=([number of events reclassified as higher\u00c0number of events reclassified as lower]/number of events)\u00c0([number of nonevents reclassified as lower\u00c0number of nonevents reclassified as higher]/ number of nonevents). A P value <0.05 was considered significant. All analyses were performed using SPSS version 19.0J for Windows (IBM Corporation), Stata version 11 (Stata Corporation), and SAS version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute Inc)."

The study was approved by Institutional Review Board of Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences (AJUMS). Four health centers in Ahvaz were selected by random sampling in 2009. Staff members of these health centers collaborated in data collection and a medical student collected questionnaire from these health centers. Because of low prevalence of non-BF mothers, at first, all non-BF mothers (78 non-BF mothers) attending health centers were requested to participate in the study and then 78 BF mothers participated through random sampling and their consent was acquired orally. We tried to consider similarity in other variables such as some risk factors of PPD (21) between the two groups. Exclusive BF is defined as the feeding of breast milk only, and no other liquids or solids with the exception of drops or syrups consisting of vitamins, minerals supplements, or medicines (25). This method was assumed for at least six months (6) for the BF group, and they were reassessedfour months later for continuation of BF. Mothers who discontinued BF due to precautions for taking medications were excluded. Participants were asked to complete demographic and obstetric data questionnaires and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Demographic and obstetric data questionnaires contained maternal age, employment history, educational level, economic status, previous history of depression or PPD, previous history of abortion or still birth, type of delivery, gender of infant, number of previous pregnancies, infant gender satisfaction, pregnancy satisfaction, and reason for BF cessation. The EPDS is a 10-item self-report scale for measuring the intensity of depressive symptoms experienced within the past 7 days. Each statement is rated on a scale from 0 to 3 (\"yes, most of the time\" to \"no, not at all\"), total score ranging from 0 to 30. Seven of the 10 items are scored reversely (26). The cut-off score for indication of PPD is 12/13 or greater (26)(27)(28)(29). For the first time, Cox et al. designed EPDS as a screening tool for the secondary prevention of PPD (30) with established validity and reliability. A cut-off score of 13 or greater identified probable postnatal depression with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 78% (31). The best cut-off point in Iranian sample is 12/13 with sensitivity of 95.3% and specificity of 87/9% (32), which can be used 6-8 weeks after delivery to screen for PPD (5). We used EPDS with cut-off of 12 and translated it to Farsi. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) windows version 13.0. Results were calculated as frequencies (%), means and standard deviations. Groups' comparisons were done by chi-square test and odds ratio (95% confidence interval) and t-test. A probability of P<0.05 was considered statistically significant."

The maximum concentration (C max ) and the time to C max (T max ) were the observed values. The time when the concentration fell to half of C max , T half-max , was calculated based on linear interpolation from the mean concentration profiles. The area under the concentration-time curve to the last measurable concentration, AUC last , was estimated by the linear trapezoidal rule. The AUC inf was calculated as AUC last \u00fe C last /k e , where C last is the last measurable plasma concentration and k e is the terminal rate constant. The half-life was calculated as ln(2)/k e . Clearance uncorrected for bioavailability of loxapine (CL/F) was calculated as total dose/AUC inf . For each of the 3 metabolites (7-OH-loxapine, 8-OH-loxapine, and amoxapine), the AUC inf ratio of each metabolite to loxapine was calculated for each subject."

It involved 112 participants in four sessions with 28 participants in each (20 voters and 8 politicians), and each subject participated in only one session. It was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Sa \u02dco Paulo School of Business Administration (Getu \u00b4lio Vargas Foundation), designed and implemented with z-Tree (Fischbacher 2007), and participants were recruited through advertisements, emails and posters on campus in the previous weeks. Subjects earned, on average, 20 Reais (around 8 USD), all rounds were paid, and each session lasted only for about 1 h. 7 There was no follow-up session. 6 There is no monitoring or sanctioning, for the vote is secret, and subjects, just as voters in reality, are bound only by their moral and ethical convictions at the time of casting their vote, and of complying with the norm. 7 Considering the exchange rate in November 2014. R$ 20 for 1 h is a very substantial amount in Brazil, where the minimum wage was, at that time, R$ 3.25 per hour, and the average wage was around R$ 11 per hour."

The resulting overoptimistic 'confirmatory' results are often referred to as 'systematic bias'. Similarly, 'information leak' from data to methods can occur from improper and repeated cross-validation. In the general case, information leak results from developing or training an algorithm based on the entire available data set so that the test set is not independent. In some cases, the leak can occur subtly and inadvertently such as when a very similar sample is present both in training and test set. A better-known effect is 'overfitting', in which a model is developed with superior accuracy on its training data at the cost of reduced generalization of the model to new data sets. A notable example of this effect can be found in the Note that we did not find any self-assessment paper where the presented method was not top ranked in at least one metric or data set. The survey was conducted over a large pool of scientific peer-reviewed papers selected as follows. First, a Google Scholar search using the keywords 'computational biology method assessment' was conducted.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from peripheral blood by standard Ficoll separation, as previously described (5). Human peripheral blood samples were obtained with full informed consent from patients with HCC. In total, six samples were collected between January 2014 and July 2014 at the Department of Gastroenterology of Renmin Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine (Shiyan, China). The isolated cells were resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 1,000 U/ml interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) and incubated at 37\u02daC for 24 h. Then, recombinant human interleukin (IL)-2 protein (cat. no. 202-IL-050; R&D Systems, Inc.) and mouse anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)3 monoclonal antibody (cat. no. MAB100; dilution, 1:1,000; R&D Systems, Inc.) were added at 500 U/ml and 50 ng/ml, respectively. Subsequently, the cells were refreshed with RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with IL-2 (500 U/ml) every other day for 10 days prior to being subjected to flow cytometry analysis.  6 CIK cells were harvested and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen, China), and resuspended in 100 \u00b5l PBS/BSA. The cells were then incubated with the above conjugated monoclonal antibodies separately for 20 min at 4 o C, washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 400 \u00b5l PBS. Flow cytometric analysis was performed with a BD FACSCalibur\u2122 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and the data were analyzed using the WinMDI software, version 2.9 (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA). The dead cells and debris were gated out."

The unit cell structure was obtained by a least-square fitting method (homemade software employing a modified Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm) using the positions of 15 clearly measurable, overlap-free peaks in powder spectrum. The unit cell dimension is slightly smaller than the predicted one, similar as the case for compound 1 noted earlier. Using the experimental crystal structure, we re-calculated the transfer integrals and found much stronger coupling along the a-axis; V P increased from 0.0415 to 0.0687 eV whereas V T1 and V T2 are the same. Thus, the transfer integrals suggest that mobility along a-axis would be highest; we expect only a moderate anisotropy in the mobility in the ab-plane as all three transfer integrals are reasonably high. Ensuing calculated mobility of 3.36 cm 2 V \u2212 1 s \u2212 1 for the crystal is only slightly higher than the predicted value of 3.34 cm 2 V \u2212 1 s \u2212 1 ."

It is shown in the table 1 (See Table 1) to a most important descriptive variables around the research study; the Research Sheet of the empirical analysis of this pa per. It has been necessary 3 rounds to get a Unique Model based on the very similar ideas of the Financial and Treasury Directors of the MCC (past and present ones). This technique has been using with the help of a Crossimpact Matrix 1 to a better explanation of the relationship of variables relate to Cash pooling and using the quantitative matrix to a more objecti ve representation of the correlation between variables. It has been used 15 hours and interviews were fully recorded and transcribed. Content analysis was carried out using Nvivo10 software: going regularly from theory to fieldwork and back, allowed the codification, the organization into a hierarchy and the theorization of collected data, more particularly finding and including the concept of organizational routines. Moreover it is necessary to take into consideration that MCC is growing into the internationalization and globa lization processes because as the conventional companies it is the aim of the companies to expand their product and services and create value in a global sense. It is necessary into the international economy to the survival of companies (SanJose et al. 2013). But, most of the Mondragon multi nationals are market-seeking, in the early days of the inter nationalisation process, and some of them are obliged to follow their big manufacturing clients abroad as suppliers. There are other motives for the internationalization, for example the low production costs; primarily through cheap and wellmotivated unskilled or semiskilled labour. \"If the MCC cooperatives are to compete against large industrial multinationals, they must develop their own multinational production and distribution networks\" (Errasti et al. 2003: 559). However, although its interest and relative influence the internationalization it is not the aim of this paper."

The autocorrelation functions were analyzed with Origin (Microcal Software, Northhampton, MA). FCS measures the fluorescence fluctuations arising from fluorescent molecules as they pass the detection volume to obtain information about dynamic processes at the molecular level (35). Using FCS, the time dependent fluorescence signal F \u00bc dF + hFi is described by the fluorescence fluctuations dF(t) about an average value hFi. These fluctuations are analyzed in the form of a normalized autocorrelation function G(t), where t denotes the correlation time (Equation 2)."

Mortality due to scorpion sting in the tropical and semi-tropical areas of Iran is about 75%, and this makes scorpion sting in these areas a serious medical problem. Because of this problem, our aim was to assess the epidemiological aspects of scorpion sting in Bandar Abbas, Iran, during 2009-2011. Methods: In this cross-sectional retrospective study, epidemiologic data of 698 scorpion sting cases, who were referred to the Shahid Mohamadi Hospital of Bandar Abbas in Hormozgan Province collected from 2009 until 2011. The data included demographic and individual information, such as age, gender, geographic location, bite site, when the incident occurred, and anti-venom consumption. The required data were extracted from the patients' recorded information in the Hospital, and we recorded data in a special checklist and imported the data into the computer for statistical analysis using of SPSS software, version 21.0. Descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation, frequency, and percentage, were used for data analysis. Results: Two hundred and sixty-one (37.4%) of the cases were urban and 437(62.6%) were rural. Males comprised 50.1% of the cases, and women comprised 49.9% (p >0.05). Twenty-five point two percent of scorpion sting cases occurred among people in the 21 to 30 age group, and there were very few cases among people in the 51 to 60 age range (p<0.05). Most of cases were recorded in April and October, and the fewest cases were recorded in July and January (p<0.05); also 32.2% of scorpion sting cases occurred after midnight and in the early morning hours. Conclusion: Our survey showed that there was a high incidence of scorpion stings in rural areas, among 21-30 age group, among housekeepers, and among students. These results indicate the need for public education programs and better sanitation services in the rural areas around Bandar Abbas city. Prospective studies can help to health and medicine organization for prevention and treatment of scorpion sting."

With commercially available software (Radi Medical Systems, Uppslae, Sweden), the shaft of the pressure wire can act as a proximal thermistor, sensor near the tip of the wire simultaneously measured the pressure and temperature acting as a distal thermistor. Thermodilution technique was used to check the the transit time of room temperature when saline was injected down to coronary arteries (8). 3 mL aliquots of room temperature saline was administered to the coronary artery, and the resting mean transit time (baseline mean transit time [bTmn]) was measured. Steady state of maximal hyperemia was induced by intravenous infusion of adenosine (140 \u00b5g/kg/min). Three additional 3 mL aliquots of room temperature saline was injected, and the hyperemic mean transit time (hTmn) was measured. The simultaneous measurements of mean aortic pressure (Pa, by guiding catheter) and mean distal coronary pressure (Pd, by pressure wire) were also obtained during the resting state and maximal hyperemic state. The CFR thermo was calculated, dividing the resting hTmn by the bTmn. The IMR was defined as the simultaneously measured distal coronary pressure divided by the inverse of the hTmn (12,13)."

For the digest, 100 mg of all five samples were dialyzed using slide-a-lyzers into 50 mM Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, pH 8.0, at 4 C overnight. Subsequently, 0.1 units plasmin (1.05 U plasmin/mg Protein, Roche Diagnostics) were added to each sample and incubated at 25 C for 72 h. After the digest, plasmin-treated samples (50 mg) were deglycosylated by adding 0.5 mL N-glycanase plus (Roche Diagnostics) and sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.1) to obtain a final sample volume of 115 mL. The mixture was incubated at 37 C for 18 h. For denaturing, 100 mL of 6 M Gua\u00a2HCl (Pierce) were added. The mixture was incubated at 37 C for 30 min. Samples were desalted by SEC (Sepharose G-25, isocratic, 40% acetonitrile with 2% formic acid). ESI mass spectra (Cve) were recorded on a Q-TOF instrument (maXis, Bruker) equipped with a nano ESI source (TriVersa NanoMate, Advion). MS parameter settings were as follows: Transfer: Funnel RF, 400 Vpp; ISCID Energy, 0 eV; Multipole RF, 400 Vpp; Quadrupole: Ion Energy, 4.0 eV; Low Mass, 600 m/z; Source: Dry Gas, 8 L/min; Dry Gas Temperature, 160 C; Collision Cell: Collision Energy, 10 eV; Collision RF: 2000 Vpp; Ion Cooler: Ion Cooler RF, 300 Vpp; Transfer Time: 120 ms; Pre Puls Storage, 10 ms; scan range m/z 600 to 2000.

Animal stool samples were collected from 13 pet stores (store nos. A to M) in the Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, between September 2012 and November 2014. The samples were stored at 4\u00b0C for up to five days prior to being sent to our laboratory. Approximately 2 g of each stool sample was suspended in 20 ml of Yersinia enrichment broth according to Ossmer (Mer-ck, Darmstadt, Germany) or 20 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS). These suspensions were incubated at 32\u00b0C for 24 hr and at 4\u00b0C for 3 weeks, respectively. Following incubation, each of the enrichment broths was streaked (with or without KOH treatment) [21] onto Yersinia selective agar supplemented with cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin (Oxoid Ltd., Hampshire, U.K.) and MacConkey agar (Oxoid Ltd.). The plates were incubated at 32\u00b0C for 20 hr and at 25\u00b0C for 48 hr, respectively. Following incubation, suspected colonies were selected and cultured on Columbia Blood Agar (Oxoid Ltd.) plates containing 5% sheep blood. Identification of the bacteria was performed as previously described [21]. The O serogroup of the isolates was determined by slide agglutination test using commercial antisera (Denka Seiken Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The biotype of the isolates was determined as previously described [21] using API 20E (BioM\u00e9rieux, Tokyo, Japan), API 50CH (BioM\u00e9rieux) and API ZYME (BioM\u00e9rieux). The pathogenicity of the isolates was confirmed by PCR targeting the virulence genes, yadA, ail and virF [17,22]. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis was performed as previously described [15] using the NotI restriction enzyme (Roche Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan) and CHEF-MAPPER system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, U.S.A.) with a switching time of 5 to 8 sec for 19.5 hr at 14\u00b0C. Salmonella enterica serotype Braenderup strain H9812 digested with XbaI (Roche Diagnostics) was used as a standard size marker. Macrorestriction patterns were compared using BioNumerics 4.1 software (Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium). A Dice coefficient and the unweighted-pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) algorithm with a 1.0% band tolerance and 1.0% optimization were used to generate a dendrogram."

Meaning the value of %recovery in walking with efficient use of gravity is high. The %recovery value was calculated for each phase shown in Fig. 1, and the averages of one whole gait cycle, and the stance phases of the paretic and the non-paretic sides were calculated. The data of gait speed, Power-y, Power-z, Power-ext of each phase, and %recovery, were compared among the three conditions of: gait with patients' own AFOs, with the PF-AFO at the first fitting, with the PF-AFO after continuous use. R 2.8.1 software was used for statistical analysis, and the Steel-Dwass method was applied. The level of significance was chosen as less than 5%. "

For both the lumen and the media-adventitia interface, automatic border detection was performed at the predefined lesion segment and manual correction was subsequently performed and required the agreement of two independent, experienced cardiologists. Disagreements were reviewed by a third cardiologist. After confirming the border detection, the software automatically calculated and displayed the results. For each frame, histologic findings were expressed in colors (green for fibrous, green-yellow for fibro-fatty, white for dense calcified, and red for necrotic core area). The predictive accuracy of this method with tissue mapping has been validated. 13) The area (mm 2 ) and percent area of each tissue component of plaque were analyzed at the minimal luminal area site, and the volume (mm 3 ) and percent volume of each tissue component of plaque were evaluated within the full segment of the culprit lesion. The plaque volume was divided by the lesion length to adjust for varying lesion lengths and recorded as a corrected volume (mm 3 /mm)."

A Bitcoin wallet is software that allows the receiving, storing, and sending of (fractions of) Bitcoin units. 3 The next step is to exchange fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, for Bitcoin units. The most common way is to open an account at one of the many Bitcoin exchanges and to transfer fiat currency to it. The account holder can then use these funds to buy Bitcoin units or one of the many other cryptoassets on the exchange. Due to the widespread adoption of Bitcoin, the pricing on large exchanges is very competitive with relatively small bid-ask spreads. Most exchanges provide order books and many other financial tools that make the trading process transparent."

Data collecting and handling were carried out using dedicated software (Spectacle; TSP). The electrophoretic analyses were performed using a fused silica capillary (35 cm from injector to detector, 42 cm total length, and 50 \u00b5m internal diameter) as previously described. 22 Samples were injected in hydrodynamic mode for 3 seconds. The voltage applied was 17.5 kV, and ultraviolet (UV) detection was performed at 254 nm for adenine nucleotides or 200 nm for PCr. The capillary was thermostatically maintained at 25\u00b0C. The separation buffer used in all experiments was sodium tetraborate (20 mM) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (1 mM), adjusted to pH 9.2. The spatial area of each peak was calculated by integrating the area of the migration time. For each standard, the area under the curve was plotted against the concentration injected and calibration curves were constructed. From the spatial area of each peak on the electropherogram of each heart sample extract, the concentration of each substance was determined from the calibration curves."

Both, object diameter (based on extinction) as well as fluorescence intensity (510 nm) of each nl-reactor, were measured concomitantly by pulse shape analysis (COPAS profiler software). First, the system was calibrated by analyzing 300 nl-reactors in order to set an adaptive fluorescence intensity threshold just above the main, non-fluorescent, population, which was evaluated to be at 780 AU (at 510 nm). Next, gates for a ToF value of 600-1000 AU were applied for dispensing of nL-reactors into a 96-well microtiter plate. For sampling of the control group, the same ToF gates were applied and 48 putatively PCR-negative nl-reactors featuring signal intensities below the adaptive threshold (600-780 AU) were sorted out. All samples were immediately processed further in order to recover the plasmids (see next section)."

For in vivo imaging, Alexa Fluor 633 -labelled P140 was injected through the retro-orbital venous sinus of anaesthetised mice. Mice were immediately transferred into the cabinet of the NightOwl Bioimager (Berthold Technologies, Thoiry, France ) and images were taken periodically for 3 h. Mice were then killed to collect organs for fi nal fl uorescence acquisition and validation of biodistribution. Signal intensity was evaluated using the Indigo software."

In four scenarios of original (branded) to generic and generic to generic substitution, 5,000 virtual patients were simulated per scenario using the programming software R. The mean population AUC of generics ranged from 90-110% (scenarios A and B) and 80-123.5% (scenarios C and D) of the AUC of the original. Those patients who had an AUC change (ratio) as a result of drug substitution of less than 0.67 or greater than 1.5 were considered to be in potential danger due to the substitution. We found that less than 6% of patients fell outside of the cutoff range of 0.67-1.5 as a result of original to generic substitution. However, in the case of generic to generic substitution, the proportion was as high as 9-12%. This alerts us to the potential danger of generic substitution, especially for drugs with narrow therapeutic indices."

(2008b). Two micrograms of total RNA extracted from different banana fruit tissues and organs treated with RQ1 DNase (Promega, Charbonnie `res, France) to remove possible contaminating genomic DNA were used. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from these RNA using AMV reverse transcriptase enzymes (Promega, Charbonnie `res, France) and random hexamers according to the manufacturer's instructions. To hamper the effect of putative PCR inhibitors that might be present in the reverse transcriptase reaction, as well as pipetting errors, the cDNA was 10-fold diluted with distilled water, and 5 ll of the diluted cDNA was used as a template for qPCR analysis. The qPCR program included one cycle of 5 min at 94 \u00b0C for template denaturation and Taq activation, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 94 \u00b0C for template denaturation, 15 s at 50 \u00b0C for primer annealing, and 30 s at 72 \u00b0C for primer elongation. Fluorescence was analysed using Sequence Detection Software (Applied Biosystems Courtaboeuf, France). A cycle threshold value (Ct) was calculated from the amplification curves by selecting the optimal DRn (emission of reporter dye over starting background fluorescence) in the exponential portion of the amplification plot."

First, we used the cumulative incidence function (CIF) to estimate the crude effect of age and sex on RCSM and OCM. Second, the Fine and Gray competing risks regression models were used to examine the effect of sex on cause-specific mortalities stratified by age groups after adjusting for possible confounds. The subdistribution hazard ratios (SHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed, with SHR less than 1.00 indicating reduced mortality. Finally, we analyzed the joint effect of age and sex on RCSM. We also assessed the effect required of a hypothetical unmeasured binary factor to explain the observed SHR of sex using sensitivity analysis. All the analyses were stratified by localized disease and regional/distant disease, because OCM makes a substantial contribution to deaths in localized disease, whereas RCSM accounts for the majority of deaths in regional/ distant disease. All statistical analyses were performed with R software using the packages cmprsk, survival and riskRegression [27][28][29] . The P value was two tailed and was considered to be statistically significant when P , 0.05."

To check for normal distribution of quantitative variables was applied the Shapiro-Wilk test. In the event that the data were normally distributed, the means between groups were compared by Student's t test. Otherwise, we used the Wilcoxon test or the Kruskal-Wallis test when more than two groups were compared."

In parallel, the protein concentrations were determined using a micro-BCA kit (Protein Assay Reagent; Pierce/Thermo Scientific). Typically, 20 mg of protein was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Advantec, Tokyo, Japan). The membrane was probed with anti-ErbB1 (Eptomics Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA), anti-ErbB2 (Eptomics Inc.), anti-ErbB3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), anti-ErbB4 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), or anti-phospho ErbB2 or anti-phospho ErbB3 antibodies (Cell Signaling; Eptomics Inc.). We used fresh blotting membranes to detect total and phosphorylated ErbB2 proteins as the conventional stripping procedure did not allow us to reuse the membrane that had been treated with the antiphospho ErbB2 antibodies (data not shown). A blotting membrane was also probed with the anti-Sulf-1 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). After extensive washing, the immunoreactivity of the membrane was detected with a horseradish peroxidaseconjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin followed by a chemiluminescence reaction (ECL kit, GE Healthcare Japan Co., Tokyo, Japan or Immuno Star LD, Wako Chemical, Tokyo, Japan). The intensity of an immunoreactive band, whose size matched the authentic molecular weight, was measured by a CCD camera and an image processing software, GENETOOLS (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). Comparable protein loading was confirmed by Western blotting using an anti-b-actin antibody (Merck Millipore Japan, Tokyo, Japan)."

This study aimed to assess the nurses' competence level and its possible relationship with their personality and emotional intelligence. Methods: Using a cross-sectional survey design, three instruments including Nurse Competence Scale, short form of Schutte Self Report Emotional Intelligence Test, and the short 10-item version of Big Five Factor Inventory, were administered simultaneously to a randomized stratified sample of 220 nurses working in hospitals affiliated to Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 11.5. Results: Majority of nurses rated themselves as \"good\" and \"very good\", with the highest scores in \"managing situations\" and \"work role\" dimensions of nurse competence. A relatively similar pattern of scores was seen in competence dimensions, personality and emotional intelligence, among male and female nurses. Emotional intelligence and personality scores showed a significant relationship with nurses' competence, explaining almost 20% of variations in nurse competence scores."

This produces a functional relationship of the form Prob(GRADE \u03ed 1) \u03ed \u233d(\u2423 \u03e9 \u2424GRADE), where estimates of \u2423 and \u2424 are produced by maximum likelihood techniques. The graph is produced by plotting the standard normal CDF, \u233d(\u2423 \u03e9 \u2424GRADE) for the values of GRADE in the sample, which range between 2.0 and 4.0, then connecting the dots. The nonparametric regression, although intuitively appealing because it can be viewed as making use of weighted relative frequencies, is computationally more complicated. Today the binomial probit model can be fit with just about any statistical package, but software for nonparametric estimation is less common. LIMDEP version 8.0, produced by Econometric Software, Inc., was used for both the probit and nonparametric estimations. The nonparametric approach is based on the assumption that there is some as yet unknown functional relationship between the Prob(GRADE \u03ed 1) and the independent variable, GPA, say Prob(Grade \u03ed 1 | GPA) \u03ed F(GPA). The probit model based on the normal distribution is one functional candidate, but the normality assumption is more specific than we need at this point. We proceed to use the data to find an approximation to this function. The form of the \"estimator\" of this function is F(GPA*) \u03ed \u233a i\u03edall observations w(GPA* \u03ea GPA i )GRADE i .The weights, w(.), are positive weight functions that sum to 1.0, so for any specific value GPA*, the approximation is a weighted average of the values of GRADE. The weights in the function are based on the desired value of GPA, that is GPA*, as well as all the data. The nature of the computation is such that if there is a positive relationship between GPA and GRADE \u03ed 1, then as GPA* gets larger, the larger weights in the average shown above will tend to be associated with the larger values of GRADE. (Because GRADE is zeros and ones, this means that for larger values of GPA*, the weights associated with the observations on GRADE that equal one will generally be larger than those associated with the zeros.) The specific form of these weights is as follows:"

The rates were also computed conditional on the exception application status. Independence between RRB decision and removal for transplantation was assessed using a chisquared test for both the overall sample and within each region, and odds ratios comparing approved and denied patients were computed. P-values for the within-region tests were corrected using the Holm-Bonferroni method. A likelihood ratio test was used to assess the regional variation in the effect of application status on the odds of receiving transplantation. Mortality rates for exception approved and denied patients were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier estimate; the difference in survival between the groups was assessed using the log-rank test. The hazard ratio for denied vs. approved patients was estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model. Patients with Removal Code 8 in the OPTN database (indicating removal due to death) were recorded as having had the event; survival times for all other removal codes were treated as censored.

We also stratified participants into three different groups according to their age (between 45 and 54, between 55 and 64 and between 65 and 75). IF's prevalence per sex and age group was also quantified. The \u03c7 2 test was used to assess for statistically significant differences in each most prevalent IF category between sexes and in brain atrophy and WMH between participants with or without a family history of AD.

Chi-square tests were used to compare the frequencies of gender, employment status, marital status, family history of psychiatric disorder, subtype of bipolar disorder, polarity of initial mood episode, psychiatric and medical comorbidities, and accompanying psychotic features between the attempter and nonattempter groups. We applied Bonferroni correction over the univariate analysis of covariance and chi-squared tests for clinical characteristic variables and considered it significant when the twosided probability was less than 0.0045 (0.05/11). Finally, we performed logistic regression analysis to simultaneously identify risk factors that were significantly associated with suicide attempts. Results were considered significant when the two-sided probability was less than 0.05 in the logistic regression analysis.

LSDA: the angle formed by the intersection of two lines drawn through the inferior end plate of L 5 and the superior end plate of S 1 (Figure 1C) 4. LLA: the angle formed by the intersection of two perpendiculars to lines drawn through the superior end plate of L 1 and the inferior end plate of L 5 (Figure 1D). Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago IL, USA). Prior to analysis, we verified the normality of continuous variables distributions and tested the homogeneity of their variances with the Levene's test. Continuous variables were expressed as mean and standard deviation. Comparison of means of both sets of data was done using the Student's t-test for independent samples. Statistical significance was set at P-value ,0.05."

Univariate analysis was performed to test the parameters for potential survival benefit using Kaplan-Meier statistics and Log rank testing. Multivariate analysis was performed to delineate any independent variables. A Cox regression analysis with stepwise backward procedure was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs). Variables with a P value of greater than 0.05 were excluded. The concordance index (c index) was used to rank the prognostic indices in order of best discriminator of patient outcome. The Frank Harrell RMS packages were used to identify a subgroup of predictors by backward elimination. We validated the C statistic by a similar bootstrap procedure using re-sampled data, using 150 iterations (Harrell, 2010). A combined score was derived using logistic regression and predicted probabilities. ROC analysis was subsequently undertaken to derive a resulting C statistic. All statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS statistical package 11.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). 1. The median age of the patients at baseline was 61 years (range 33-86). A significant proportion of patients had more than one site of metastatic disease (47%), the commonest site being the liver (45%). Almost all of the patients received at least one line of chemotherapy (93%). At the time of analysis, 56 patients had died with an overall median survival of 5.9 months (range 0.7-42.9). Four patients under active surveillance had a median follow-up time of 10.2 months (range 3.8-29.9)."

MATERIALS AND METHODS. The experimental groups were designed by the number and type of magnetic attachment. Twenty samples were tested with Magden implants. Each attachment was composed of the magnet assembly in overdenture sample and the abutment keeper in a mandibular model. Dislodging forces were applied to the overdenture samples (50.0 mm/ min) in 3 directions. The loading was repeated 10 times in each direction. The values of dislodging force were analyzed statistically using SPSS at 95% level of confidence. RESULTS. The retentive force of group 2 was greater than that of group 1 in both types of attachment in every direction (P < .05). Oblique retentive force of flat type magnetic attachment was higher than that of cushion type attachment in both groups (P < .05). In group 1, oblique retentive force showed the highest and anterior-posterior retentive force showed the lowest value in both attachment types (P < .05). In group 2, both types of attachment showed the lowest retentive force with anteriorposterior direction of dislodging force (P <.05). CONCLUSION. Proper retentive properties for implant overdenture were obtained, regardless of the number and type of magnetic attachment. In both types of magnetic attachment, the greater retentive force was attained with more implants. Oblique retentive force of flat type magnetic attachment was greater than that of cushion type. Among all subgroups, anterior-posterior retentive force was the lowest among three different directions of dislodging force."

Here the data showed that the expression of all the four genes responded positively to exogenous glucose treatment at a time point as early as 6 h (Fig. 4). The expression of the genes was induced with a steady rise after 6 h, peaked at 18 h (MYB28 and CYP79F2) or 24 h (MYB29 and CYP79F1), and then decreased sharply at 36 h. The expression levels of MYB28, MYB29, CYP79F1, and CYP79F2 increased by ~8.4-, 2.5-, 1.8-, and 1.3-fold, respectively, at 18 h after the 3% glucose treatment when compared with sorbitol treatment. So, 18 h after treatment was set as the harvest point of Arabidopsis plants for further analysis of gene expression."

If it is the size of constituencies that matters, then voting by representatives-at-large and senators from the same states should be similar, controlling for legislators' personal characteristics, 14 As DW-NOMINATE is constructed solely from roll call data, it incorporates both member beliefs and the ideological positions of constituents that elect members into Congress. See Fleck and Kilby (2002). 15 The simulations were performed with the \"(21), as both datasets are exclusively protein-based and therefore cannot be mapped to Clarify\" software developed by Tomz et al. (1998). 16 See Karol (2007) for an application of this experiment to trade policy voting. 17 The number of states with a representative-at-large has changed over time due to population and migration shifts. For the votes in my sample, the states with a single representative include Alaska , Delaware (1945), Hawaii (1959), Montana (1991), Nevada (1945-1978), North Dakota (1970, South Dakota (1980Dakota ( -2009, Vermont (1945( ), and Wyoming (1945. since they have identical constituencies. But if there is some unmodeled reason other than constituency size that accounts for why senators support the IMF more than Representatives, then voting by senators and representatives-at-large will be significantly different. Table 5 presents the results of this experiment. Model 6.1 is the baseline model. Model 6.2 adds REP-AT-LARGE and SENATE * REP-AT-LARGE, the interaction of the Senate dummy and the binary variable indicating whether a member is from a state with only one representative. The interaction term picks up the cases where senators and representatives have exactly the same constituencies-it is a formal test of the hypothesis that constituency size explains the Senate-House gap in support for the IMF. Notice that the SENATE point estimate is virtually identical across Models 6.1 and 6.2 while the estimate for the interaction term SENATE * REP-AT-LARGE is not significantly different than zero. 18 This means we cannot reject Hypothesis 2: the Senate-House gap in support for the IMF is the same for representatives-at-large and other cases, ceteris paribus. Put another way, legislators serving in the Senate are no more pro-IMF than legislators in the House when they have identical constituencies."

Samples (~2 mg) were mixed with ~198 mg of KBr (Sigma-Aldrich Corp) and ground into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle, before being compressed into a disk (Perkin Elmer 15.011; PerkinElmer Inc.). Each spectrum was acquired in transmittance mode (ten scans) with a resolution of 4 cm -1 and spectral range of 4,000-500 cm -1 . The analysis was finally focused in the range of 2,000-500 cm -1 as the most informative for the IR spectra of silk fibroin for these assays."

The reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.2 mM EcLeuRS or its mutants and incubated at 37 C. Aliquots (1.5 ml) were quenched in 6 ml of 200 mM NaAc (pH 5.0). The quenched aliquots (1.5 ml each) were spotted in duplicate on polyethyleneimine cellulose plates pre-washed with water. Separation of Nva-[ 32 P]AMP, [ 32 P]AMP and [ 32 P]ATP was performed by developing thin layer chromatography (TLC) on polyethyleneimine cellulose plates in 0.1 M NH 4 Ac and 5% acetic acid. The plates were visualized by phosphorimaging, and the data were analyzed using Multi Gauge Version 3.0 software (FUJIFILM). The gray densities of [ 32 P]AMP spots were compared with the gray density of known [ 32 P]ATP concentrations.

Evidence for this conclusion lies not just with greater incidence of multiple authorship in quantitative journals, but with the uneven nature of the increase in multi-authored papers. The two critical periods-the mid-1960s and the period since the mid-1970s-approximately coincide with two major technical developments. The early 1960s saw the mainframe computer become established as an important tool for quantitative economic research with TSP, the first major econometrics software package, becoming available in 1967. The mid-1970s and later saw the introduction of the personal computer, with 1977 marking the launch of both the Apple II and the Commodore Pet, and 1981, the IBM PC. Since then, developments have centered around the speed and memory size of personal computers, together with an enormous growth of sophisticated software and a communications revolution."

Candidate biomarkers of response were measured in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary tumor material using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and were tested for their associations with PFS, OS, and best overall response (BOR).

Overall survival probabilities were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The following predictors were selected for model development based on previous multivariable analyses (Polterauer et al, 2011): age (continuous variable), FIGO stage (IV vs III vs II vs IB), the presence of positive lymph nodes (positive vs negative), and at the presence of positive lymph nodes lymph node ratio (LNR; continuous variable), parametrial involvement (positive vs negative), and tumour size (p2 vs 42 cm). Lymph node ratio was defined as the ratio of positive and totally removed lymph nodes, as previously described (Polterauer et al, 2010). FIGO stages IA were excluded from predictive modelling, as only one event was observed in this group. The model was constructed by estimating a Cox regression model, maximising a likelihood function with a ridge (sum of squared regression coefficients) penalty term to prevent against over-fitting potentially caused by the small number of events in our study (76 events). This type of analysis can deal with data sets in which the number of events per variable is much less than 10, as it prevents overfitting by shrinking the coefficients compared with those by standard Cox regression (Ambler et al, 2012). The tuning parameter that controls the amount of shrinkage of regression coefficients by the ridge penalty was optimised by maximising the average of the 10-fold cross-validated partial likelihood over 10 different random partitions of the data into 10-folds (Ambler et al, 2012). We decided to include all preselected variables irrespective of significance as nomogram parameters as even non-significant variables must be assumed to have a non-zero effect on survival. Correlation analysis between clinical variables was performed using Spearman and Kendall tau-b rank correlation coefficients. Interactions of any predictors with FIGO stage were evaluated by comparing the cross-validated partial likelihood with and without these interactions. Likewise, we checked for non-linear effects of age or LNR by employing the technique of fractional polynomials and compared the crossvalidated partial likelihood with and without nonlinear modelling (Royston and Altman, 1994). We used the R package glmnet (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) for estimating the model coefficients (Simon et al, 2011)."

Specifically, a model was built on each of the 1000 training sets following the same process as described above. The 1000 models were then evaluated on the original data (test set) without modification, estimating 5-year survival probabilities for each patient. For each of the validation models, we constructed a time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve using the survival ROC package of R (Heagerty et al, 2000). As a measure of discrimination, we computed the median and IQR over the optimism-corrected time-dependent areas under the ROC curves (the c-indices) obtained in each of the models and provide a summary c-index as described previously (Steyerberg, 2009 andUno et al, 2011). The calibration of the prediction model was assessed by stratifying the patients, by their risk score, into four quartiles, and evaluating the observed 3-and 5-year survival probability in each quartile by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The mean predicted 3-and 5-year survival probabilities, averaged over the 1000 models, were compared with the averaged observed survival probabilities in calibration plots. If the model is well calibrated, this plot should demonstrate agreement of the predicted and observed survival probabilities."

We compared the pattern of first failures and survivals between CT-CCRT and RT-CT protocols. Comparison between the two protocols was analyzed using a chi-square test or Fisher exact test for categorical variables and the Student t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. Survival time was calculated by the interval between the date of the surgery and the date of the last follow-up or events (death event for OS, first loco-regional failure for LRFS, and first distant metastasis for DMFS). Survivals were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression model were used for www.e-roj.org http://dx.doi.org/10.3857/roj.2016.01802 univariable and multivariable analyses, respectively. Factors with a p-value of less than 0.2 by a univariable analysis were used for a multivariable analysis. Two sided p-values less than 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using R statistical packages [13]. This study was reviewed and approved by the Ajou University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board (AJIRB-MED-MDB-13-036)."
