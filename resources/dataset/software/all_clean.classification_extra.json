                    "full_context": "CRISPRs' in silico analyses started in 1995 (2) but no specific stand-alone CRISPR software tool was created. Several software were used by different authors to identify these particular repeats but usually a manual discard of background was necessary, and generally some CRISPR clusters were missed or neglected, especially the shortest one (less than three motifs). This is the case, for example, of Tandem Repeat Finder (17) when considering a motif (DR \u00fe spacer) as a degenerate repeat (10,18), or Locating Uniform poly-Nucleotide Areas (LUNA), a program for finding degenerate repeats in microbial genomes on a desktop computer. The repeats can be filtered using several parameters including length, distance and level of conservation. LUNA was used especially for finding CRISPRs in archaea (4,15). Another program, Patscan (19) a pattern-matching tool that searches sequences fitting the introduced pattern, was applied toidentify CRISPRs containing at least three (20) or four exact direct repeats (8). PYGRAM (21) is a visualization program browsing all the repeats in the submitted genomic sequence and showing perfectly conserved palindromic repeats as pyramids. The PYGRAM program is mostly efficient in visually displaying large CRISPRs (CRISPRs with as many as seven motifs are considered as being very short in this work) since they will be recognized as a concentration of horizontal bars referring to a group of co-occurring repeats that differ by only a few nucleotides. Finally, Haft et al. (12) used REPfind (http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/reputer/), a part of the REPuter package (22-24) and BLASTN to identify smaller repeat clusters.",

They require further manual manipulations to eliminate background data (tandem repeats for example) and importantly, do not define accurately the DR consensus (due to errors on the boundaries). Recently, two CRISPR-dedicated software tools were proposed, CRT (http://www.room220.com/crt) and PILER-CR (25). Both of them run fast and perform well in finding CRISPRs. However, CRT results in a considerable background since tandem repeats are considered as putative CRISPRs and in addition, the same CRISPR is sometimes detected more than once with different consensus DRs. PILER-CR has also some drawbacks since it often misidentifies the DR boundaries and omits the truncated DR.",

Non-redundant sequences were then aligned to genomic RNA and mRNA sequences of hg19 using Bowtie 2 (www. bowtie-bio.sf.net) (35) and matched sequences were retained and aligned to common and abundant non-coding RNAs (tRNAs, rRNAs, snoRNAs). Remaining sequences were further aligned to known mature and precursor miRNAs using the miRbase 19 database (www.mirbase. org). Additional alignments to a transcript database ( Ensembl version 75, http://www.ensembl.org) (36) and the specific piRNA database piRNABank (http://pirnabank.ibab. ac.in/) were also performed (37). Alignment result files were parsed using the R statistical language (http://www. R-project.org) and the Bioconductor project (http://www. bioconductor.org) (38) to generate tables including the read count and annotation information for each entry in the target database. Raw read counts for each RNA class from all samples in the study were then joined in raw data tables. The raw reads were converted to reads per kilobase of target length per million mapped reads (39). All sequences were deposited into the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/geo/) under accession number GSE56076. Calculation of percent of reads by biotype was based on raw read counts of perfectly matched transcripts for each biotype compared to total reads for each library.",

                    "full_context": "The ta-siRNA, a newly identified class of 21-nt short siRNAs, play an essential role in bridging the miRNA and siRNA pathways, which were previously believed to be two independent processes (2-5). Phase-initiators direct the cleavage of ta-siRNA gene (TAS) primary transcripts (precursors) and subsequently initiate the production of ta-siRNA clusters (4). To date, only a few known phase-initiators are ta-siRNAs as most of reported phaseinitiators are miRNAs. Following cleavage of the precursor, the 3 0 (or 5 0 )-cleavage products are converted into double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by RDR6 and SGS3. The dsRNA is then processed into 21-nt increments, relative to the original cleavage site on both strands, by DCL4 in order to produce ta-siRNA clusters (3,4). The ta-siRNAs form an essential component of the RISC complex responsible for guiding AGO-dependent cleavage of the target transcript. Based on these data, several researchers have proposed a 'miRNA ! ta-siRNA ! target gene' cleavage cascade as an element of gene regulatory network in the model plant Arabidopsis (4-7). In this paper, we describe the development of the pssRNAMiner, a plant short small RNA regulatory cascade analysis server that is able to identify potential ta-siRNAs clusters and their phase-initiators.",

Gene lists were tested for over-represented GO terms using the DAVID website. 52 The Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 Array served as the background gene list. Only GO terms at specificity levels 4 or 5 within the directed acyclic graph hierarchy defined by the GO Consortium were included. 53 The minimum hit threshold was set to 3. Over-represented GO terms were ordered by the EASE score P-value, a conservative modification of Fisher's Exact test designed to de-prioritise annotation terms containing very small numbers of genes. 54 Ingenuity pathway analyses. Gene lists and log2 expression fold-changes were uploaded into the IPA tool (Ingenuity Systems, www.ingenuity.com). When more than one probe set mapped to the same gene, the probe set with the largest fold-change was used. Pathways and interaction maps were constructed using the path designer function, with expression changes overlayed onto the pathways. Gene lists were also analyzed in IPA for overrepresented cellular and molecular functions and for association with disease. P-values were adjusted by the Benjamini and Hochberg algorithm to control the FDR at o5%.",

The SCN slices were prepared according to our standard method 6 and kept at 35 \u00b0C in a sealed 35 mm petri dish with 1 ml of the culture medium containing 1 mM luciferin. The bioluminescence from the cultured SCN was measured with a highly sensitive cryogenic CCD camera (Spectra Video SV16KV/CT: Pixelvision) equipped with a microscope (Axiovert 135TV: Carl Zeiss). Observed data of images were filtered through a median filter to eliminate cosmic-ray-induced background noise. The luminescence was recorded every 20 min. Periods of SCN luminescence recordings were estimated using Fast Fourier Transform-Nonlinear Least Squares analysis 60 as part of theBiological Rhythms Analysis Software System (BRASS). For all SCN to be compared, identical segments of raw SCN luminescence values, starting from the first trough since the start of the measurement, and containing at least four complete cycles, were analysed. BRASS has been developed by Dr Brown PE and co-workers and is available from http://millar.bio.ed.ac.uk/Downloads.html. Intraventricular infusion of THFA. THFA (Tocris) was continuously delivered to the SCN via osmotic pump as described 29. In brief, the tip of the infusion cannula (Alzet, Brain Infusion Kit 2) was directed stereotaxically to the SCN and the osmotic pump (Alzet, pump model 1002) containing 100 mM THFA (118 \u00b5g/day, infused at 0.24 \u00b5l/h) was placed in a subcutaneous pouch by surgery under anaesthesia. We performed the surgery during the subjective daytime (CT8-10) when the phase of circadian clock is considered irresponsive to light. Following the surgery, animals were returned to their home cages and maintained in DD.",

With this approach it is possible to simulate an uncertainty that is always associated with projects. After the fuzzy model is constructed, it is necessary to tune it (to set up the inputs on known values, evaluate the results and to change the rules or weights, if necessary) when the model was built. If the fuzzy model is tuned, it is possible to use it in practice. For implement the fuzzy model in MATLAB can also created an executable file called M-File. M-file is used to enter the input values and automatically evaluate the total risk of the project.",

Thus, data from 50 patients (16 re-instructed vs. 34 not re-instructed) were extracted from the acute pain service electronic database (Table 1). Table 2 summarizes data collected regarding DD ratios, pain scores, morphine consumption, and SIA and C-SIA scores.

They consist of a succession of highly conserved regions (DR) varying in size from 23 to 47 bp, separated by similarly sized unique sequences (spacer) of usually viral origin.

A maximal repeat 26) is a repeat that cannot be extended in either direction without incurring a mismatch. The total number of maximal repeats in a sequence of size n is linear (less than n) which is interesting since the computation may be done in linear time using a suffix-tree-based algorithm. A CRISPR pattern of two DRs and a spacer may be considered as a maximal repeat where the repeated sequences are separated by a sequence of approximately the same length.",

Automated reconstruction and volumetric segmentation of images were conducted using FreeSurfer 5.1 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/), which is widely used and provides accurate renderings of regional volumes without rater bias. We used an imaging protocol that maximizes differentiation of the white and gray matter boundary (3D spoiled gradient-recalled at steady state, TE 3.0 ms, TR 7.8 ms, TI 600, 8\u00b0 flip angle, NEX 1, 1-mm axial slice thickness, FOV 25.6 cm, 256 \u00d7 256 matrix). MRIs for each participant were motion corrected, normalized for intensity in homogeneities, and transformed to Talairach space. Non-brain tissue was removed using a hybrid watershed/surface deformation procedure, subcortical structures were segmented, and further intensity normalization was conducted. This was followed by white-matter segmentation, tessellation of the gray-white matter boundary, and automated topology correction. Finally, surface deformation following intensity gradients optimally placed the gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid borders at the location where the greatest shift in intensity defines the transition to the other tissue class. The cerebral cortex was parcellated into 34 gyral-based regions in each hemisphere based on the Desikan-Killiany atlas [33]. Subcortical structures were delineated by an algorithm that examines variations in voxel intensities and spatial relationships. Anatomical accuracy of the segmentations was manually verified. To account for differences in head size, volumes for each region were divided by intracranial volume (ICV).",

Depending on the goals of the course and the experience of the instructor, the filtering and taxonomic assignments can be done with the students. Alternatively, these steps can be performed by the instructor outside of the class and the taxonomic classification and relative abundance data can be used in class. Many of the academic and commercial sequencing facilities will perform filtering and basic analysis of the raw sequence data. Classes that do not have a wet lab component can analyze data collected by students in other courses or data collected by other investigators.",

The talk is intrinsically interesting. For example, he points out that the world has made a transition over recent decades from being divided into two groups, long life/small family and short life/large family, into a world where most countries outside of Africa have long lives and small families. But especially striking is that Rosling has founded a nonprofit software provider called Gapminder to provide vivid moving illustrations of how countries' health and economic statistics evolve over time. Recorded February 2006. Rosling's presentation is available at the Technology Entertainment Design website at \u0357http:// www.ted.com/tedtalks/tedtalksplayer.cfm?key\u03edhans_rosling\u0358.

(a) An illustration of structure-based sequence alignment and hidden state paths. In Sequences 1 and 2, uppercase letters and lowercase letters represent aligned core blocks and unaligned regions, respectively. If two corresponding unaligned regions bounded by the same two core blocks are of different length, we split the shorter one into two pieces and introduce contiguous gaps in the middle. For both N-and C-terminal ends, the shorter unaligned region is pushed toward the core blocks. Secondary structure (ss) types (helix, 'h'; strand, 'e'; coil, 'c') are shown for Sequence 1. The hidden state paths for three models are shown below the amino acid sequences. (b) Model structure of HMM_1_1_0. Residue pairs in unaligned regions are modeled using the same match state ('M') as those in the aligned blocks. Insertions in the first sequence and second sequence are modeled using states 'X' and 'Y', respectively. (c) Model structure of HMM_1_1_1. Residue pairs in the unaligned regions are modeled using a different match state ('U') than the match state in the core blocks ('M'). (d) Model structure of HMM_1_3_1. Residue pairs in aligned core blocks are modeled using three match states ('H', 'S', 'C') according to three secondary structure types of the first sequence. In (b), (c) and (d), match states are shown as squares and insertion states are shown as diamonds. Begin state, end state, and transitions from or to them are present in these models, but are not shown. (Figure 1a). Residue pairs in aligned core blocks can be modeled by a match state ('M'). If the two unaligned regions in between two core blocks have different and non-zero lengths, they can be modeled using a different 'match' state ('U', for unaligned) (Figure 1c) and 'X' or 'Y' state. This is done by evenly splitting the unaligned residues in the sequence with the shorter unaligned region into two segments, placing them beside the two adjacent core blocks and separating them by a single stretch of gap symbols. In this way, transitions between 'X' and 'Y' do not occur. The residue pair emission probabilities of these artificially forced matches in unaligned regions ('U') are expected to be different from those in the core blocks ('M'). This model (HMM_1_1_1) has two distinct match states: 'M' and 'U' (Figure 1a and c).",

An initial alignment is built progressively guided by the tree with a simple sum-of-pairs scoring function. A second tree is then built with a UPGMA method based on sequence identities calculated from the initial alignment. We then apply the probabilistic consistency strategy as described by Do et al. (23). For each sequence pair, we calculate the match probabilities of residue pairs using one of the HMMs. These probability matrices are subject to consistency measure, which involves multiplications of the matrices (23).

Our program is named MUMMALS, standing for MUltiple alignment with Multiple MAtch state models of Local Structure. MUMMALS was compared to several other programs, such as ProbCons (23), MAFFT (11), MUSCLE (10)and ClustalW (7). We assembled testing datasets of multiple sequences by adding homologs to pairwise alignments of SCOP domain pairs (see Materials and Methods). For three testing datasets with identity ranges below 20%,MUMMALS shows 3-4% increase of average Q-score over ProbCons when the best-performing HMMs are selected (HMM_1_3_1 and HMM_3_3_1) Table 2). For the dataset with identity range above 20%, the improvement is less prominent (1%), although still statistically significant (P < 0.005). Among the other programs tested (ProbCons, several options of MAFFT, MUSCLE and ClustalW), MAFFT with options [lg]insi usually gives the best performance. Our program still outperforms any MAFFT option by 2% for the three datasets with identity ranges below 20%. The other two large datasets we have used for testing are PREFAB version 4 (PREFAB4) (10) and SABmark version 1.65 (33). PREFAB4 consists of 1682 alignments based on the consensus of two structural alignment programs SOFI (40) and CE (41), with up to 24 homologous sequences added from database searches. SABmark database has two alignment sets. The 'twilight zone' set contains SCOP (version 1.65) domain pairs with very low-to-low similarity and the 'superfamily' set contains SCOP domains with low to intermediate similarity. The reference alignments in SABmark were also derived from the consensus of SOFI and CE. The comparison of MUMMALS with the other programs on PREFAB4 and SABmark shows similar trends as seen in datasets assembled by us. MUMMALS with the best-performing models (HMM_1_3_1 and HMM_3_3_1) gives the highest average Q-scores, with 2-4% increase over ProbCons and 1% increase over the best of theMAFFT series (Table 2).",

                    "full_context": "Among existing multiple aligners, MUMMALS is methodologically closest to ProbCons. However, we implement HMMs that are different from the one used in ProbCons in three aspects. First, we introduce more complex model structures by increasing the number of match state types. While HMM_1_1_0, used mainly as a control, has the same model structure as the one in ProbCons, the other four models (HMM_1_1_1, HMM_1_3_1, HMM_3_1_1 and HMM_3_3_1) incorporate more match states, which take into account residue substitution differences in unaligned regions and aligned core blocks, as well as local structural differences in aligned core blocks. Second, we have estimated model parameters from DaliLite structural alignments of divergent SCOP domains (<40% identity), while the training data of ProbCons are from BAliBASE2.0. Third, we applied a supervised learning approach to estimating model parameters from structural alignments that have known hidden state paths. ProbCons applied an unsupervised learning approach (expectation maximization) to derive parameters without using reference alignments. Trained and tested on DaliLite structural alignments of SCOP40 domain pairs and on BAliBASE2.0 alignments, our models give better alignment quality than ProbCons and a number of other programs. We show that more complex models improve alignment quality and SCOP40 superfamily pairs with identity range of 20-40% provide a better training dataset than BAliBASE2.0 alignments.",

On the demand size, country size and GDP per capita determine the size of markets and demand composition. With the reshaping of the world economy, the patterns of international demand will be affected profoundly. Meanwhile, the capabilities of countries will change, as developing economies accumulate human capital, invest in infrastructure and new production capacities and progressively catch up in terms of efficiency. Finally, markets will change as well as exporters, leading to a profound revamping of world trade patterns. MIRAGE is providing a detailed description of these changes for a given classification of countries and regions and a given sectoral aggregation of traded goods and services. The transformations of bilateral and sectoral trade flows are driving changes in the sectoral value added in each country, which leads to a reallocation of resources and ultimately changes in factor prices. Last but not least, these reference trajectories will be 'bent' by the shocks to trade costs or the migratory movements simulated in various scenarios.",

Exonic deletions, nonsense mutations, and frameshift mutations were categorized as having no residual activity, except for a frameshift mutation that affected the final 20 amino acids. Splice site mutations affecting the 2 conserved donor or acceptor nucleotides and predicted in silico as likely affecting splicing were considered to leave no residual activity. For missense mutations in GLDC, the impact on residual P-protein activity was assessed by expression in vitro in COS cells and measuring the residual enzyme activity on a glycine exchange assay modified by the use of purified human recombinant lipoylated H-protein. 22 Missense mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into a full-length GLDC cDNA in the pCMV6-Entry vector (RC211292; Origine, Rockville, MD), and with mock and wild-type GLDC included in each experiment, were transfected into COS7 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were harvested after 48 hours, and P-protein activity was measured by the glycine exchange assay containing excess lipoylated, recombinant human H-protein. 22 Activities were normalized by protein concentration measured by the Bradford method 23 and mutant enzyme activity expressed as percentage of concurrent wild-type enzyme activity determined in the same experiment. Transfection efficiency was monitored by quantitative PCR for GLDC cDNA content. To generate recombinant, lipoylated human H-protein, GCSH cDNA PCR amplified from a human liver cDNA library was cloned as a thioredoxin fusion protein into the pBAD-DEST 49 vector (Life Technologies), expressed in bacteria, and purified from the cell lysate by boiling for 1 minute followed by chromatography on a diethylaminoethyl cellulose column. Lipoate-protein ligase (LplA) from Escherichia coli was expressed, purified, and used to lipoylate purified human H-protein as described using a molar ratio of 0.5:1.0 LplA:H-protein. 24 Lipoylation was confirmed by Western blotting (ab97625; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and by mass spectrometry. The N-terminal thioredoxin tag was removed from the lipoylated H-protein by enterokinase digestion (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), and reaction products were separated using a Q Sepharose Fast Flow (GE Healthcare BioSciences, Pittsburgh, PA). Following transfection in COS cells, steady state Pprotein levels were identified by Western blotting following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using an antibody against the P-protein from Abcam (ab97625), with b-actin as a loading control. Coexpression studies used cotransfection with vectors containing both mutants compared to transfection with a single mutation and an empty vector. A model of human P-protein encoded by the GLDC gene was created using the homology modeling program ESyPred3D based on the crystal structure of holo glycine decarboxylase from Synechocystis (Protein Data Bank ID: 4LHC). 25,26 The relative locations of mutated residues in the 3-dimensional model were viewed using the program RasTop 2.2 (http://www.genein- finity.org/rastop/).",

One mg RNA each from unfractionated MSC EV preparation and ST-EVs was used for library construction. The library for high-throughput sequencing was constructed using TruSeq Small RNA Library Prep Kit (Cat. #RS-200-0024) and applied to an Illumina High Seq 2000 sequencing system (Illumina, USA) for 101-nt single-end sequencing. The reads obtained were trimmed of their ligation adaptors and reads shorter than 18 nts were discarded. The remaining reads were mapped against a collection of human rRNA sequences to filter out ribosomal RNA-like reads. The unmapped reads were subsequently mapped to Reference genome hg19 from the UCSC genome browser (www.genome.ucsc.edu/). The ENSEMBL gene annotation (GRCh37) was used to annotate the mapped reads based on its genomic location. For details of the analysis method, please refer to ''Supplementary Material and Method.'' Western blot hybridization Western blot hybridization was performed using standard protocols. Briefly, proteins were denatured, separated on 4\u00c112% polyacrylamide gels, electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with a primary antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies against the primary antibody. The primary antibodies used in this study were mouse anti-human CD9, CD81, ALIX, TSG101, CD59, b-ACTIN (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) and EDA-containing FN1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA).

For income and dividend processes and participation rates based on historical data, the model predicts an unrealistically small equity premium. We have increased the assumed volatility of aggregate income to increase the predicted premium, but want to emphasize that this may not be a neutral adjustment with respect to the other quantities of interest.10 4.2.1 Income and Preferences Let y(t) -log[Ya(t)/Ya(t -1)] be the growth rate of aggregate nonmarketed income at time t. Then the aggregate state of the economy is given by z(t) = [y(t) d(t)]', which is assumed to be generated by a Markov chain. To calibrate a process for z(t) we assume that a period corresponds to 25 years. The first period roughly corresponds to the working years between age 40 and retirement, and the second period is the time in retirement. Over the period 1889 to 1985, the average annual (log) growth rate in real aggregate consumption was 1.7% with a standard deviation of 3.5%. So that the model will produce a nonnegligible equity premium, we assume that the standard deviation of the aggregate growth rate in the model is 1.5 times the historical standard deviation of aggregate 9. The Matlab code is available upon request. 10. Recently Campbell and Cochrane (1998) suggested that time-varying habit provides a higher estimate of the equity premium in a model based on aggregate consumption. However, Cochrane (1997) claims that this preference specification cannot account for the recent run-up in stock prices.consumption. For the same reason, we assume that annual income growth is independently and identically distributed over time, although in fact it is slightly negatively autocorrelated. This implies a 25-year average (log) growth rate of 42.5% with a standard deviation of 17.5%. This distribution is discretized by assuming that y takes on the values 0.16 and 0.69 with equal conditional probability. The capital share in total income averages approximately 30%. Consistent with the aggregate statistics reported in Heaton and Lucas (1998), we assume that only half of this capital income is actually tradable. The nontradable portion, generated by private business holdings, is accounted for in nonmarketed income. Since dividends in the model are scaled relative to nonmarketed income, this means that we require d(t) to average 18%. In most of the calculations d(t) is fixed at 18%. In other experiments described below, we assume a more volatile dividend process to proxy for a lack of diversification.11",

Mouse kidneys were fixed in 10% buffered formalin saline (Thermo Scientific, Runcorn, UK) for 24 hours. Fixed kidneys were processed and paraffin embedded according to standard procedures. A series of 5-\u03bcm coronal kidney sections was prepared at 200-\u03bcm intervals from each kidney. Kidney sections were hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained and scanned to create virtual HE slides using an Aperio system (http://www.aperio. com/?gclid = CNXN-8by4a UCFcINfAods3eg1w). Virtual slides were used for lesion quantification. Maximum cross-sectional whole area and cellular area of each renal lesion were measured, respectively, using ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij). Cellular areas of renal lesions were obtained from parenchyma and stroma. To estimate average size of tumor cells, cysts and papillary and solid tumors on HE-stained kidney sections were randomly chosen using ImageJ. Average size of tumor cells was determined from parenchyma (not stroma) through total area of all tumor cells divided by the number of tumor cells examined. Analysis was conducted blindly with respect to treatment status.",

Hence, RNALocate provides a more specific subcellular localization resource in which to efficiently investigate, browse and analyze a particular RNA, and even provides insight into the functions of hypothetical or novel RNAs. The whole data set can be easily queried and downloaded through the webpage, and visualization tools for interactively browsing and analyzing the data set are provided. In addition,RNALocate also allows researchers to submit new RNA subcellular localization.",

                    "full_context": "GO is a hierarchical graph-based annotation system where the terms closer to the root describe more general information while those away from the root provide more specific information about a given GO category. The root (level 0) describes three main GO categories at level 1, which are \"biological process\", \"molecular function\" and \"cellular component\". We used GO terms only from the \"biological process\" and \"molecular function\" categories because the data for the \"cellular component\" category are very sparse. Ideally, we would have used GO terms that provide specific descriptions on the processes or functions; however, the more specific the terms get, the less frequent they are, which prohibits meaningful comparison of GO term frequencies across different cancer. Hence, we chose the GO terms at level 4 for our analysis because at this level, GO terms are more specific (than those at previous levels), while generic enough to cover broader groups of related processes or functions to attain reasonable cumulative frequency for analysis. All the GO terms associated with a protein sequence were obtained from the GO database as graph paths, which have an inherent hierarchical order starting from the root (level 0). Since our goal is to compare the number of common GO terms across different cancer types, these GO terms must be selected at the same level in the graph path (for all cancers) to make the comparison meaningful. We developed a Perl program to store all the graph paths for a given protein. Using this program, under each GO category (except the \"cellular component\"), the common GO terms for a given pair of PPIs were determined at level 4 to calculate the frequency of common GO terms in a given cancer. Since the size of PPI dataset (Table 1) varies across different cancer types, frequencies of common GO terms were normalized against the number of PPIs, showing at least one common GO term in each cancer dataset. This normalization ensures a fair comparison of the common GO term frequencies across different cancer types irrespective of the size of PPI datasets used. The top 20 most frequent common terms were selected from each cancer, which were combined to obtain a nonredundant set of GO terms under the biological process and the molecular function categories, respectively.",

Additionally, on the sameThe hypothesis that the GOI belongs to the population of the random gene sets is tested and a P-value is returned. In addition, users may choose from several visualization tools to discover more about the functional relationships between the GOI. day an ontology file was downloaded from http://archive.geneontology.org/ latest-termdb/go_daily-termdb.obo-xml.gz. The definition file was also downloaded from the GO website and it was used to construct a DAG in the biological process subspace. We have developed a  Python library with a set of application programming interfaces for building different GOrelated graphs and performing various queries (Muller et al., 2009). This library is based on the Python package NetworkX (Hagberg et al., 2008). In a graph representation of the GO, referred to as GOGraph, each node (vertex) represents a GO term and each directed edge corresponds to the IS_A relationship between a parent-child GO term pair. The directed edges between terms represent their semantic relationship such that the concept of a parent node subsumes those of its children nodes. Hence, the constructed GOGraph obeys the 'true path rule' or in other words the pathway from a child term to the most top-level parent is always true. Then, genes are added as another type of node to the GOGraph via an edge to its associated GO term(s) to create the GOGeneGraph. The GOGeneGraph is further modified by the addition of edges between terms that share the same gene annotations. Associating GO terms with the genes they annotate enables the calculation of semantic distance for edges from a GOGraph using the established methods, see Section 2.2 for details. After initialization of the edge distances, the graph is further transformed into a weighted, undirected graph, so that the functional coherence of list of GO terms can be reflected by connectivity and distances among the terms rather than the directionality. The algorithm for constructing a GOGeneGraph is detailed in Supplementary Algorithm 1.",

To assess whether relationships based on perceptions differed from those based on objective data, we ran a survey using Amazon Mechanical Turk (https://www.mturk.com) to explore attitudes towards blood donations across 78 high-and low-income countries. The survey and overview of the results are available with the online appendix. The results show that, similar to the objective data, controlling for a country's income, respondents from volunteer collection countries are more likely to believe their country is collecting blood effi ciently and distributing it fairly (p < .05). However, respondent's perceptions of the safety to either the donor or recipient do not vary with the percent of blood collected from volunteers (p > .85).

Well-publicized images of lines outside blood the $211 unit cost reported above). Well-publicized images of lines outside blood donor centers immediately after 9/11 likely exacerbated the problem by signaling donor centers immediately after 9/11 likely exacerbated the problem by signaling that donating was the normatively appropriate behavioral response (Cialdini et al. that donating was the normatively appropriate behavioral response (Cialdini et al. 1993), despite virtually no change in demand for blood. 1993), despite virtually no change in demand for blood. Of course, one option for collection agencies to address excess supply is to Of course, one option for collection agencies to address excess supply is to separate the red cells, platelets, and plasma, with the idea that at least the plasma separate the red cells, platelets, and plasma, with the idea that at least the plasma can be stored, although the red cells would still be discarded after six weeks. This can be stored, although the red cells would still be discarded after six weeks. This option is limited by centrifuge and fi ltration capacity constraints. When a disaster option is limited by centrifuge and fi ltration capacity constraints. When a disaster response is local, supply can be shipped to other locations having centrifuge and response is local, supply can be shipped to other locations having centrifuge and fi ltration capacity. However, when disaster responses are spread over a larger area fi ltration capacity. However, when disaster responses are spread over a larger area or are national in scope, there is nowhere to send the excess supply. Yet another or are national in scope, there is nowhere to send the excess supply. Yet another option is for collection agencies to turn away volunteer donors, though this policy option is for collection agencies to turn away volunteer donors, though this policy has not usually been followed for fear that volunteers may take this as a signal that has not usually been followed for fear that volunteers may take this as a signal that they should not bother donating in the future. they should not bother donating in the future.",

These initial mappings were both expanded and refined by a form of local de novo assembly in all regions of the genome that appeared to contain variations based on these initial mappings. The de novo assembly fully leverages mate-pair information, allowing reads to be recruited into variants with higher sensitivity than genome-wide mapping methods alone typically provide. Assemblies were diploid, and sequencing produced two separate result sequences for each locus in diploid regions. Variants were called by independently comparing each of the diploid assemblies to the reference. The original computational methods for small variant detection are available at: http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/ full/10.1089/cmb.2011.0201.

After PCR amplification, the amplicon was double digested with XhoI/ NotI for 2 hours following the manufacturer's protocol. The PCR product was subsequently subcloned into the XhoI/NotI sites downstream of the Renilla luciferase (r-luc) reporter gene (psiCHECK-2; Promega). The authenticity and orientation of the inserts relative to the Renilla luciferase gene were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. The resulting recombinant plasmids were designated psiCHECK/CDK6-UTR. Finally, transformed bacterial cultures were grown and each reporter construct was purified the PureLink Hipure Plasmid Maxiprep kit (Invitrogen).",

We demonstrated that DEG7 orthologues are restricted to fungi and plants, including various algae and land plants. Using Y2H assays and SEC (size-exclusion chromatography) with recombinant DEG7 purified from E. coli, we show that trimerization of DEG7 monomers is mediated by the second (degenerated) protease domain. [26] [27] [28] [29]DegP and DEG1 from A. thaliana, representing the best examined Deg/HtrA proteases from animals, bacteria and plants respectively, were chosen as outgroups, since they do not belong to the DEG7 group [4]. Models of the first and second half of DEG7 were created using the MODELLER 9v6 program [30] with multiple template alignment, using the structure files 2pzd.pdb [31], 1lcy.pdb [7], 3cs0.pdb [12] and 1ky9.pdb [9] as templates.

Slides were viewed under fluorescence using a DMRB microscope (Leica) equipped with a Retiga EXi camera (QImaging) and Volocity imaging software (PerkinElmer) and searched for the expression of feline neutrophil elastase and Campylobacter. Images were taken when a field of view (9400 objective) contained a neutrophil elastase expressor and one or both of the Campylobacter expressors. A record was made of any neutrophil elastase expressors that did not have a Campylobacter expressor in the same field, as well as the overall presence of C. jejuni and thermophilic Campylobacter. Image J software (http:// rsb.info.nih.gov/ij) was used after images had been captured to allow automated measurement of the distance between two points selected by the user-neutrophil and Campylobacter. The distance was measured in pixels on the digital images. The maximum field size used was 1850 pixels. The use of this software allowed multiple accurate measurements to be taken and compiled for statistical analysis.",

The coordinates of spots were extracted in Matlab and track histories generated using a Matlab version of the IDL nearest-neighbor algorithm (www.physics.emory.edu/\u223cweeks/idl/). To detect the very faint mApp-\u03b22AR (+) scission events, the fluorescence of candidate spots was quantified using a circle-minus-annulus measurement in which segmented spots were excluded from the annulus. This eliminated a major source of noise in the fluorescence measurement and allowed a more accurate estimate of fluorescence.",

On the one hand, some of these data providers have data that are directly accessible on the Web. For example, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS, <http://www.abs.gov.au>) has over 1 million web pages through which a huge array of past and present Census data can be accessed, as well as an extensive array of surveys and reports related to the Australian population. On the other hand, many other national and statebased agencies do not offer access to their 'data', preferring instead to release data in aggregated forms; for example, as written reports. Being able to access and combine distributed data from multiple independent and autonomous organisations through a unified environment would greatly simplify the life of many urban researchers and allow major urban research challenges to be systematically tackled. Ideally, such a solution would offer live (programmatic) access to in situ remote data resources from the definitive data providers and avoid web scraping or other ad hoc data collection mechanisms that would break when websites and their content change. The solution should provide tools to support collection and enrichment of provider-specific metadata to enable complex data analytics scenarios using this diverse ecosystem of data. The AURIN platform has delivered such an integrated, data-rich research environment. AURIN is not unique in this endeavour and a range of efforts is currently ongoing-albeit on a much more focused domain; for example, with a fixed or known set of data providers.",

Chemicals were removed if their structures could not be found. Each dataset was carefully curated according to previously established guidelines (Fourches et al., 2010). Briefly, counterions were removed, whereas specific chemotypes such as aromatic and nitro groups were normalized using the ChemAxon Standardizer (v.5.3, ChemAxon, Budapest, Hungary,http://www.chemaxon.com). The presence of duplicates, i.e., identical compounds reported more than once in the same dataset, is known to lead to over-optimistic estimations of the predictivity for developed QSAR models. However, the analysis of such records also gives an estimate of the dataset quality: if activity data for the same compound are consistent, the overall data quality is high; if there is a large deviation in experimental values between different records of the same compound, the quality is, obviously, low. Thus, after the structural standardization, the duplicates were identified using ISIDA Duplicates (Varnek et al., 2008) and HiT QSAR (Kuz'min et al., 2008) software and carefully analyzed. If the experimental properties associated with two duplicative structures were identical, or highly similar, then one compound was chosen at random and deleted. However, if their experimental properties were significantly different, we deleted both records from the dataset. During the curation of human skin permeability dataset, we found 17 pairs of duplicate structures and two sets of triplicates as shown in Table S3. The permeability values for duplicative records were almost identical (logKp variation ~ 0.01 LU) except those for butanoic acid that had a variation higher than ca. 0.4 LU. Thus, the LogKp value for all 17 compounds was averaged and the duplicative records were removed so that only one permeability coefficient was used for a chemical compound.",

In this study, we have employed the Sequential Agglomerative Hierarchical Non-overlapping (SAHN) method implemented in the ISIDA/Cluster program (http://infochim.u-strasbg.fr) (Varnek et al., 2007). Briefly, each compound represents one cluster at the start. Then, the m compounds are merged iteratively into clusters using their pairwise Euclidean distances stored in a squared (m * m) symmetric distance matrix. The two closest objects (molecules or clusters) are iteratively identified and merged to form a new cluster, the distance matrix being updated with the re-computed distances separating the newly formed cluster and the others, according to the user-specified type of linkage (complete linkage in this study). The process is repeated until one cluster remains. The parent-child relationships between clusters result in a hierarchical data representation, or dendrogram. In particular, we used ISIDA/Cluster to obtain the heat map (see Results section) of the proximity matrix.",

A drop of the backbone RMSD between experimentally determined and modeled loops (only the top hit was considered) starts to become evident for loops with eight residues length.

                    "full_context": "The IS X is capable of capturing high-resolution images of individual cells at a rate of up to 5,000 cells per second. The new IS X -CBMN method is able to process cell samples suspended in solution and eliminates the need to create microscope slides, thereby reducing the time required for sample preparation (17-19). All images captured on the IS X are saved to a data file which is analyzed using the Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS V R ) built specifically for the IS X . Previously, we generated dose response calibration curves from 0-4 Gy (17,19) and 0-10 Gy (18) but in both cases, while a large number of BNCs were scored (about 2,000), a reduction in MN frequency by a factor of about 5-10 was observed when compared to curves generated by automated and manual slide-scoring methods respectively. This paper describes the optimization of the IDEAS analysis template for identifying and scoring BNCs and MN in the IS X -based version of the CBMN assay. In this work, we reanalyzed existing data in order to demonstrate improvements in the accuracy of identifying and separating BNCs from other cells and cellular debris, as well as improved detection of MN through the use of a newly developed MN mask. The resulting increase in MN frequency is evident in the improved dose response calibration curve in which the rate of MN per BNC is comparable in magnitude to those presented by other authors using automated slide-scoring versions of the CBMN assay.

                    "full_context": "In several recent publications, we have introduced a newly developed method for performing the CBMN assay using imaging FCM as a dose estimation tool in radiation biodosimetry (17-19). In the present study, we developed a new analysis strategy using mask functions recently implemented in IDEAS, and evaluated the performance of this analysis compared to our previous approach. First, hand-tagged truth populations (BNC and non-BNC, MN, and non-MN events) were selected which allowed for the identification of features that were able to distinguish between these populations. Direct visualization of the locations of these populations (Fig. 3) also allowed for ranges of all features to be optimized. Second, we discovered that an analysis template optimized for a single data file was, in many cases, not ideal for all conditions. By merging data collected from multiple donors at multiple dose points, the most optimized analysis template for all data files was achieved. Finally, data collected from blinded samples was used to confirm the accuracy of the optimized analysis. These strategies enabled us to substantially increase the comparability of this assay to previous published results in the literature and improve accuracy when generating dose estimations compared to our previous work. Figure 3 shows the sequential application of bivariate plots and histograms in the analysis template and demonstrates the effectiveness with which BNCs could be separated from cellular debris and other undesired objects in the data acquired by the IS X . While identification of focused, single cells can be attained from the BF images, the addition of a DRAQ5 nuclear stain also allows apoptotic cells to be gated out based on the hallmarks of apoptosis (chromatin condensation, nuclear condensation, and increased blebbing) without the use of an additional viability dye (13). All DRAQ5 stained BNCs were shown to fall between 1 3 10 5 AU and 1 3 10 6 AU of intensity indicating that the main nuclei show a relatively uniform uptake of DRAQ5. This result may allow for improved data collection to be obtained through the application of more stringent intensity classifiers on the IS X which would filter out more unwanted events during acquisition. Furthermore, the newly created BNC mask was able to better differentiate images with two DRAQ5 stained objects from those with zero, one or three or more DRAQ5 stained objects compared to the previous versions of the IDEAS template. Several of the new features developed in IDEAS that simultaneously compare the main nuclei to one another based on circularity, size, staining intensity and symmetry, allowed BNCs to be further differentiated from other undesired events. By implementing these cell-specific parameters in the IDEAS template, 99% of the tagged non-BNCs were correctly filtered from the final population on average across the dose range. In addition, 25% of the tagged BNCs eliminated with the original template were recovered and 83% of the tagged non-BNCs retained with the original template were eliminated. Figure 5 demonstrates that the optimized IDEAS analysis template generates a dose response calibration curve that is of similar magnitude to those presented in the literature and that the dose estimations from blinded samples generated using this curve are more accurate. The rate of MN per BNC as a function of dose demonstrates some variability between donors. This variability in the CBMN assay has been well documented in the literature and Kacprzak et al. (29) showed that for five donors, the rate of MN per 1,000 BNC was relatively consistent at 0 Gy but had an approximate range of 0.2-0.6 at 5 Gy. While the variability between donors across the dose range has been reduced in this work to 15% compared to 26% in our previous analysis template (18), the need for generating a calibration curve that is based on the rate of MN per BNC from multiple donors is demonstrated. In addition, the magnitude of the rate of MN per BNC in this work has increased by a factor of about four in comparison to our previous work, on average, across the dose range, illustrating the effectiveness of the optimized BNC and MN masks. In previous versions of the IDEAS analysis template, MN close to the main nuclei and smaller MN could not be scored due to the limitations in the available masking parameters, however the optimized MN mask is now able to correctly score these events which has led to the observed improvement.",

Slates tend to run Android or iOS, as well as Windows; CARAT is being re-factored to be platform-independent, to take advantage of these new options.",

The use of the stylus on the tablet screen has been popular with researchers who prefer the pen and paper approach. CARAT also includes the ability to handle constraint checking and complex conditional branching, similar to what REDCap provides. Data validation supports regular expressions, so error detection can become extremely detailed. Responses can be validated not just by data type (date, number, character string, etc.) but by complex ranges of these in almost any combination. CARAT at the moment does not implement the ability to reference multiple questions in a single validation rule, however; it can require the response field be filled in according to highly complex string-formation rules combining letters and numbers, but we can't say that the response must be less the answer to the previous question plus 100, for example. That has not been a common request from users, though it could be implemented if needed.",

The CAD algorithm was implemented by a technical computing language (MATLAB R2010a, MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). The ROI, a square portion of 64\u00d764 pixels, was extracted by dragging the mouse from a randomly selected single point to 64 pixels left and 64 pixels downward. The tooth structure, periodontal ligament, and lamina dura were excluded from each ROI. Next, the noise was removed by median filtering. Morphological skeletonization was then used to extract the medial axis of the trabecular bone, which was regarded as the prominent region that was brighter than the surrounding structures, and subsequently, the images were enlarged 64-fold. The 'strel' function was selected from the computing language to] is the size. In the matrix [2 3], the first element was the number of rows in the structuring element neighbourhood; the second element was the number of columns. Then, the most basic morphological operations, which were 'erosion' and 'dilation,' were performed. The 'erosion' function removed pixels on the object boundaries, while dilation added pixels to the boundaries of objects in an image. The number of pixels added or removed from the objects in an image depends on the size and the shape of the structuring element used to process the image. Finally, the pixel area calculation was used to estimate the area of the trabecular bone in the binary image, that is, the digital image that had only two possible values for each pixel, namely 0 and 1 (Figs. 1 and 2). The pixel area of the \"non-cleft side\" and \"cleft side\" from group 0 to group 4 were calculated and compared. The measurements were made five times, once a week, on each side by an oral radiologist. Five positions were randomly selected at the \"non-cleft side\" and \"cleft side\" on the same image. All of the pixel areas of the image were then calculated. Statistical tests were performed using SPSS 10.1 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics were applied. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to evaluate a normally distributed pixel area. Wilcoxon signed ranks test was used when the data did not show normal distribution and the paired samples t test was used when the data showed normal distribution. The study design was approved by the Khon Kaen University Ethics Committee for Human Research.",

The ROI can be controlled by using the same size and can be changed into binary images for calculating the pixel area that corresponds to the total number of pixels in the image. The CAD system could be useful for evaluating grafting failure, which would permit re-grafting before the eruption of the teeth and improve the prognosis of cleft lip and palate patients. Trindade et al 8 and Jia et al 17 showed 86% and 88% success rates, respectively, for the long term outcome of alveolar bone grafting in a UCLP group using the Bergland scale. However, their studies did not evaluate the success rate. A further prospective study would be required using this CAD system to support surgeons to determine the appropriate period for re-grafting or to explain the success of bone grafting compared with normal bone on the same image. The quantity of the pixel area might be useful for further and better treatment planning for artificial eruption in the cleft area.",

                    "full_context": "There is an increasing shift in higher education from teacher-centered to more interactive, student-centered teaching concepts. This is in part due to the known limitations of traditional lectures, such as low student attention or inefficient knowledge acquisition and translation [1]. To foster interactive learning and student engagement, in particular with large student numbers, audience response (AR) systems are increasingly used at educational institutions worldwide [2]. AR systems typically consist of an hardware transmitter (\"clicker\") that is controlled by the student, a radio-frequency receiver and a computer with software to display voting results during the presentation by the instructor, e.g. as histogram of responses [3]. AR systems are used in a variety of ways: to increase student interaction and attention, to promote in-class discussions, to evaluate student knowledge or as formative assessments for the lecturer to adjust teaching pace and didactics [2]. Recent meta-analyses in health profession education showed that AR systems are favored by the vast majority of students and likely result in improved short-term and long-term knowledge outcomes [4]. However, many instructors only reluctantly use AR systems in teaching. Frequently cited reasons are high acquisition and maintenance costs, logistic efforts or technical difficulties to operate AR system with different operating systems and presenter software [5]. To overcome these limitations we sought to develop a novel web-based AR system that is specifically adapted to the didactic needs and economic requirements of higher education. Here we present \"OnlineTED\", a novel smartphone-and web-based AR system that is free-touse, platform independent and does not require hardware clicker or additional software. Based on user evaluation data, we analyzed the strengths and limitations of \"OnlineTED\" in comparison with a conventional AR system that is used at TUM and discuss the potential of webbased AR systems for undergraduate medical education.",

After log-on, the main page conveys information for the auditorium to participate in a poll (e.g. website URL for login, session token, quick response (QR) code). For the lecturer, the main page is the starting point to create, manage or commence polls. Flags link to the sub-pages \"poll viewer\" to start of a polling session, \"quick poll\" for spontaneous polls and \"poll editor\" to create or manage question sets (see Figure 1). In the latter, new poll sets and questions in multiplechoice format can be created and saved via an online form (see Figure 2). In addition, image (gif, jpg or png), movie (mov, avi or mpeg) or sound files (mp3, aac or wav) can be uploaded and saved with each question. Other media sources of the internet (e.g. http:// www.youtube.com/) can be directly embedded. In addition to prepared and saved questions sets, the lecturer can conduct spontaneous polls by choosing different rating scales (yes / no / undecided; very low -very high; excellent -insufficient; strongly agree -strongly disagree) from the \"quick poll\" options. Students can participate in the poll after log-on to the website with any internet-enabled device (smartphone, tablet-PC, laptop). A poll is joined by entering a four-digit access code (session token) that is automatically generated and displayed for each session. Alternatively, students can scan a QR code with their mobile device. Upon session log-on, answer options are automatically displayed on the student devices (see Figure 3A ). After voting, the results are dynamically displayed in the presentation by the lecturer as growing histograms depicting the number and percentage of votes for each answer (see Figure 3B). Each poll question requires a bidirectional data transfer of approximately 0.03 Mbit. Based on the average connections speed of wireless Local Area Network (LAN) (54 MBits/s) or cellular mobile networks such as Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) (7.2 Mbit/s) [6], \"OnlineTED\" enables polls with large audiences in a typical lecture hall setting.",

Interwrite Cricket consists of 2.4 Ghz band radio receiver and radio transmitters (clicker). The system can manage up to 2047 clickers per receiver. The keypad of the clicker consists of six numeric and additional true and false buttons. The clickers are powered by two AAA batteries each that last approximately 20 weeks based on typical usage. The operative range of the clickers is up to 150 feet (45.7 m) from the receivers (in free space). Interwrite Cricket software runs on Windows, Mac and Linux and supports the generation of multiple-choice and true/false questions with a authoring software that requires installation on the computer of the presenter (http://www.banxia.com/ prs/hardware/cricket). In contrast, \"OnlineTED\" is a web-based AR system that utilizes internet-enabled end devices of the audience as handsets. \"OnlineTED\" does not require the installation of software, is fully web-based and thus can be used on any operating system. Each poll question requires a bidirectional data transfer of approximately 0.03 Mbit, which enables the participation of large audiences evenAfter log-on, the main page conveys information for poll participation such as website URL for login, session token or quick response code. Flags link to the sub-pages \"poll viewer\" to start a polling session, \"quick poll\" for spontaneous polls and \"poll editor\" to create or manage question sets.with low data bandwidth. The operative range of \"Online-TED\" is not spatially limited and thus can be used for distance teaching, e.g. webinars. Sets of multiple-choice questions can be created and manage in \"OnlineTED\", and spontaneous polls with different rating scales (yes / no / undecided; very low -very high; excellent -insufficient; strongly agree -strongly disagree) conducted as \"quick polls\" options.",

As of February 28th, 2013, the website has been accessed by 2,997 visitors with 37,696 page hits (approximately 750 visitors and 9,424 page hits per month). The overall rating of \"OnlineTED\" by lecturers was \"very good\" (5 out of 10) or \"excellent\" (4 out of 10). The didactic benefit of \"OnlineTED\" for teaching was considered \"excellent\" by 6 out of 10 and \"very good\" by 3 out of 10 lecturers. Free text comments by the lecturers indicated that \"OnlineTED\" provided a \"helpful basis for in-class discussions between students and lecturer\". In addition, \"playful discussion of topics and clinical problems\", e.g. by presenting clinical cases and questions on pharmacotherapy, drug choice and clinical management were considered a key didactic benefit of AR systems. A specific advantage of \"OnlineTED\" was seen in the possibility to \"spontaneously assess the learning and knowledge state\" of the students by using the instant poll option. When asked to compare \"OnlineTED\" with conventional AR systems using hardware clickers, the lecturers rated \"OnlineTED\" superior in seven out of nine categories (see Figure 4A ). The areas with the highest advantage for lecturers were seen in time required to use the TED system for the first time, well as its flexibility (10 out of 10 and 9 out of 10, respectively). Approximately 80% (289 of 361) of the undergraduate medical students in the studied cohort at TUM indicated to own a mobile internet-enabled device (smartphone, tablet-PC or iPad). Of these, the majority (92%, n=265) could access the polling session without difficulty using either wireless LAN or cellular data network during lectures or seminars. The vast majority of students (94%, n= 274) gave an overall rating for \"OnlineTED\" of \"excellent\" or \"very good\". \"OnlineTED\" was seen on par or superior in all categories when compared to conventional AR systems using hardware clickers (see Figure 4B).",

Our aim was to develop an AR system for higher education that is on par with commercial systems with respect to functionality and usability. Surprisingly, \"OnlineTED\" was evaluated superior in a number of categories by both students and lecturers (see Figure 4). In particular, its usability and flexibility with regard to handling, question management and in-class performance were seen as key advantages of \"OnlineTED\" in comparison to conventional AR systems. Finally, \"OnlineTED\" is a non-commerical AR system that is freely available to educators and students worldwide. A potential limitation of \"OnlineTED\" is its dependency on internet availability that may be limited or restricted at some university campuses due to poor WLAN coverageor cellular network reception. Another important issue is the safety of data on the internet. To address these concerns, \"OnlineTED\" has implemented HTTPS, a communications protocol for secure communication over a computer network that is used for sensitive data transfer e.g. electronic banking. HTTPS provides bi-directional encryption of data transfer between a client and server and authentication of the web site and associated web server [7]. As an additional safety measure, \"OnlineTED\" does not permit users to identify the IP address of devices used in a poll, thus assuring the anonymity of poll participants. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to investigate the concerns and attitudes of students and lecturers to web-based technology and its impact for higher education. Extensive research on AR systems in higher education has indicated their effectiveness on different learning outcomes, such as knowledge gain, student self-confidence and positive learner reactions (reviewed by [5], [8], [9]). The most commonly cited benefit of AR systems are the increased student engagement through active participation. However, while AR systems provide a convenient way to improve student interactivity, it is in the end pedagogy and didactic implementation that matters. In a recent study by Smith et al. [10], students were encouraged to discuss TED clicker questions with their classmates prior to voting. The authors demonstrated that peer discussions are effective means of active learning that resulted in significantly improved conceptual understanding when used with AR systems. In this regard, the frequently cited limitation of AR systems that not all students may be able to participate in a poll due to limited numbers of clickers or internet-enabled devices may offer the opportunity for collaborative voting and peer discussions in class. Another pedagogical aspect of AR systems, which is often overlooked, is its use in formative assessment and feedback. A recent report by Alexander et al. showed that AR systems can be successfully used to monitor the progress of students in the curriculum and allow students to compare their learning progress with other classmates [11]. The omnipresence of the internet and availability of computer-based technologies open up new opportunities to actively engage students in teaching. Our survey revealed that up to 80% of undergraduate medical students at TUM posses an internet-enabled device (smartphone, tablet or iPad). This results is in accordance with recent studies that 60 to 80% of UK medical students own a smartphone [12], [13]. Web-based AR systems such as \"OnlineTED\" may thus provide a feasible alternative to conventional, hardware-based AR technology in teaching and become a suitable tool to foster interactive learning and student engagement in undergraduate medical education, in particular with large audiences.",

                    "full_context": "In this article we present \"OnlineTED\", a novel web-based audience response system that is free-to-use, platformindependent and does not require hardware clickers. Our aim was to develop an AR system for higher education that is on par with commercial systems with respect to functionality and usability. Surprisingly, \"OnlineTED\" was evaluated superior in a number of categories by both students and lecturers (see Figure 4). In particular, its usability and flexibility with regard to handling, question management and in-class performance were seen as key advantages of \"OnlineTED\" in comparison to conventional AR systems. Finally, \"OnlineTED\" is a non-commerical AR system that is freely available to educators and students worldwide. A potential limitation of \"OnlineTED\" is its dependency on internet availability that may be limited or restricted at some university campuses due to poor WLAN coverageor cellular network reception. Another important issue is the safety of data on the internet. To address these concerns, \"OnlineTED\" has implemented HTTPS, a communications protocol for secure communication over a computer network that is used for sensitive data transfer e.g. electronic banking. HTTPS provides bi-directional encryption of data transfer between a client and server and authentication of the web site and associated web server [7]. As an additional safety measure, \"OnlineTED\" does not permit users to identify the IP address of devices used in a poll, thus assuring the anonymity of poll participants. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to investigate the concerns and attitudes of students and lecturers to web-based technology and its impact for higher education. Extensive research on AR systems in higher education has indicated their effectiveness on different learning outcomes, such as knowledge gain, student self-confidence and positive learner reactions (reviewed by [5], [8], [9]). The most commonly cited benefit of AR systems are the increased student engagement through active participation. However, while AR systems provide a convenient way to improve student interactivity, it is in the end pedagogy and didactic implementation that matters. In a recent study by Smith et al. [10], students were encouraged to discuss TED clicker questions with their classmates prior to voting. The authors demonstrated that peer discussions are effective means of active learning that resulted in significantly improved conceptual understanding when used with AR systems. In this regard, the frequently cited limitation of AR systems that not all students may be able to participate in a poll due to limited numbers of clickers or internet-enabled devices may offer the opportunity for collaborative voting and peer discussions in class. Another pedagogical aspect of AR systems, which is often overlooked, is its use in formative assessment and feedback. A recent report by Alexander et al. showed that AR systems can be successfully used to monitor the progress of students in the curriculum and allow students to compare their learning progress with other classmates [11]. The omnipresence of the internet and availability of computer-based technologies open up new opportunities to actively engage students in teaching. Our survey revealed that up to 80% of undergraduate medical students at TUM posses an internet-enabled device (smartphone, tablet or iPad). This results is in accordance with recent studies that 60 to 80% of UK medical students own a smartphone [12], [13]. Web-based AR systems such as \"OnlineTED\" may thus provide a feasible alternative to conventional, hardware-based AR technology in teaching and become a suitable tool to foster interactive learning and student engagement in undergraduate medical education, in particular with large audiences.",

In particular, PseudoGene database (53) identifies pseudogenes using various computational methods in genomes; HOPPSIGEN (54) represents the homologous processed pseudogenes shared between the mouse and human genomes that contains location information and potential function; as a web-based system, PseudoGeneQuest (55) identifies novel human pseudogenes based on a userprovided protein sequence; in addition, the University of Iowa's UI Pseudogenes website contains human pseudogenes and the candidates for gene conversion (56). However, these databases focus on automatic detection of pseudogenes by using a variety of homology-based approaches. Our database, pseudoMap, aims at providing comprehensive resource for genome-wide identifying the functions and regulators of human TPGs. In briefly, there are three major differentiating features from currently public databases of pseudogenes. First, pseudoMap elucidates the relationships of TPG and its cognate gene with miRNA decoys mechanism. Second, to explore the interaction of TPG and its parental gene, pseudoMap provides the gene expression profiles of TPG and its cognate gene in various experimental conditions. Third, pseudoMap curates the TPG-derived esiRNAs, which supported by deep sequencing data, as well as their interacting gene targets in the human genome. Table 3 lists the detailed comparisons of pseudoMap with other previous databases related to pseudogenes.",

                    "full_context": "The delivery approach combines elective courses in basic veterinary techniques for complementary or recurring aspects of studies with mandatory training provided in collaboration with TiHo clinics and institutes. However, elective practice and reinforcement of practical skills in small groups and the possibility of intensive preparation and follow-up of teaching content through independent study are still the main tools for learning. The increasing inclusion of self-teaching elements will focus increasingly on the acquisition of practical competencies. The approach will incorporate various forms of teaching, including peer-assisted teaching, cognitive apprenticeships, workshops (with a maximum of 8 students per group) and problem-oriented learning (POL). To this end, special teaching materials (guidance notes, display panels, posters, case studies etc.) are designed and complemented by open educational resources (OERs). This involvesusing resources such as WikiVet [19], [20]. Some documents (text, images and videos) will be made available to other universities under creative commons (CC) licences via WikiVet, Vetipedia or in the form of e-books. Existing video podcasts produced by the skills lab will be the focus of the OERs. Clinical skills learning through simulations on models (low-fidelity, medium-fidelity) will be accompanied and complemented by videos available from the YouTube channel (http://www.youtube.com/ user/TiHoVideos) which was set up in April 2012. Training videos for classes and to demonstrate particular skills on models/simulators and on live patients are continuously being created. To date, 52 videos have been created with 116 subscribers and 30,734 hits (see Figure 1, as at 30 September 2013). The videos are useful not only as preparation for a session in the skills lab, but also as a chance to verify or reinforce particular skills. The skills lab opened in February 2013 and since then has been available to students during and between semesters. Initial evaluations of the 769 visits to the teaching stations from March to September 2013 show that there was a high level of interest, and not just during semesters, in the elective teaching on offer in the skills lab of the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Foundation (se Figure 2). The largest user group is students in semesters 7-8, as they are approaching the practical year in semesters 9-10. At the time of writing, our investigations have not found any other veterinary educational establishments in Germany with skills labs, in contrast with other countries (both in Europe and further afield), which offer numerous training centres and use veterinary simulators as part of their curriculum [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. To date, there are no reports or experiments on establishing training centres in application of the Veterinary Licensing Ordinance (TAppV). The reasons for this can only be speculated -on the one hand, the TAppV and the related range of competency requirements is diverse, and not all day-one skills can be taught in a skills lab [7], [28]; on the other, veterinary studies in the past tended to focus exclusively on imparting knowledge, while practical education and skills training was normally carried out at the initiative of the universities themselves, using their own animals and patients in their own clinics [6], [29]. The required resources and the specific nature of local structures are decisive when setting up a skills lab. In addition to the cost of the necessary premises, the equipment itself (simulators, devices etc.) and the overheads (staff, consumables etc.) are very costly [11], [18]. Currently the TiHo skills lab has more than 40 models. In addition, devices and diagnostic equipment (ultrasound, endoscopy etc.) as well as a haptic trainer for transrectal examinations are provided [24]. The estimated costs totalled some EUR 480,000. 6-8 student research assistants are currently engaged in the maintenance and coordination of the teaching content, along with one fulltime member of the teaching staff who provides veterinary guidance in the skills lab. We were only able to cover this significant outlay thanks to financial support from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) aspart of the teaching quality package (Qualit\u00e4tspakt Lehre).",

Manually refined annotations were based on GeneMark.hmm coding potential analysis, the obtained protein chemistry data and colinearity with previously annotated pleomorphic virus genomes (6,20). The properties of identified proteins and the products of putative ORFs were analysed using expert protein analysis system (EXPASY) proteomics tools. Isoelectric points and molecular masses were determined using Compute pI/MW tool (29). The signal sequences for VP4-like proteins were predicted using Signal P (version3.0) (30) and TatFind Servers (31). Conserved protein signature sequences were determined using InterProScan (32). Putative trans-membrane regions of proteins were additionally determined using combined predictions by TMHMM tool (33) and TMPred tool (34). Coiled-coil regions were predicted using Coil tool (35). Multiple sequence alignments were generated using T-Coffee (36), Muscle (37) and Praline (38). Conserved DNA motifs in aligned nucleotide sequences (T-Coffee) were visualized with WebLogo (39).",

The expression of the genes was induced with a steady rise after 6 h, peaked at 18 h (MYB28 and CYP79F2) or 24 h (MYB29 and CYP79F1), and then decreased sharply at 36 h. The expression levels of MYB28, MYB29, CYP79F1, and CYP79F2 increased by ~8.4-, 2.5-, 1.8-, and 1.3-fold, respectively, at 18 h after the 3% glucose treatment when compared with sorbitol treatment.

The Lewis score evaluates three small bowel segments for the parameters villous appearance, ulcers and stenosis [61]. The Capsule Endoscopy Crohn's Disease Activity Index. (CECDAI) evaluates the proximal and distal small bowel for the parameters inflammatory lesions, disease extension and stenosis [62]. A software application for calculation of the Lewis score has been incorporated into the RAPID Reader platform for Pillcam SB. The following cutoffs have been proposed: <135, normal small bowel or clinically insignificant inflammation; 135-79, mild disease activity; and >790, moderate to severe disease [61]. The CECDAI is simpler to calculate, but cutoffs for endoscopic remission and different disease severities have not been properly established. However, there is a good correlation between the two indexes (r=0.63, P<0.0001), and in a retrospective and unblinded single reader analysis, CECDAI levels of 3.8 and 5.8 corresponded to Lewis scores of 135 and 790, respectively [40,63].",

Unfortunately, the names of the buyer and seller in the Patent Assignment database were never standardized by the USPTO. Therefore, to back out buyer patent portfolios, we need to match each buyer name manually with a unique assignee identifier required to identify the buyer's patents. Because of the large size of our sample (17,605 traded patents), we manually matched only patents that were both traded and litigated at least once in their lifetime (569 patents). In the empirical analysis below, we will focus on regression results for the entire data set (299,356 patents), but also show that the findings also our study that focuses on patent litigation, because typically it is the owner of the patent who brings patent infringement actions. Nonexclusive licensees do not have the right to sue for patent infringement (Textile Prods. v. Mead Corp., 134 F.3d 1481, 1485 Fed. Cir. 1998). An exclusive licensee may have standing to bring such a suit, but only under some restrictive contract arrangements (Resonant Sensors Inc. v. SRU Biosystems, Inc., no. 3:08-cv-1978-M). 13 For details, see the description of the TAXSIM program in Feenberg and Coutts (1993). The simulation and the resulting data are available at www.nber.org/\u223ctaxsim/state-rates/. 14 All our results are robust to dropping corporate tax rates or to using corporate tax rates in the state of the inventor, which assumes that trading of patents occurs only within states. Table 1 reports summary statistics for the key variables. Table 1A shows the fraction of sample patents involved in trade or litigation at least once in their life. Of the total sample, 4.55% of patents are traded and 0.69% are involved in at least one suit. These rates are low, but it is worth noting that, for the later patents in the sample, data on trade and litigation are truncated, and this biases downward litigation and trade rates. 16 Moreover, patents that are traded or litigated are much more valuable than those that are not (as measured by citations received). 17 The striking fact from this table is the strong association between trading and litigation. Of patents that are traded, 4.2% are also litigated; for patents that are not traded, the litigation rate is only 0.51%. Of patents that are litigated, 27.9% are also traded; for patents that are not litigated, only 4.4% are traded.",

In addition, new repetitive elements were generated from the Haruna Nijo genome assembly by RepeatModeler (http://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler.html, 7 November 2015, date accessed). These two libraries were used for repeat masking the Haruna Nijo assembly by censor 17 with -mode norm mode. For the analysis of repeat distribution, only results of repeat masking by the  TREP library were used. For comparison, genomes of Triticum aestivum, 18 Triticum urartu 19 and Aegilops tauschii 20 were repeat masked in a similar manner as the Haruna Nijo genome.",

The first postoperative and subsequent consecutive anteroposteriordigital radiographs of each hip were examined retrospectively by two independent blinded observers (E.T, C.P.), neither involved in the clinical care of the patients. Stem subsidence at two years postoperatively was measured by the two observers, as a change in the vertical distance from the proximal tip of the greater trochanter to the shoulder of the stem [8]. A computer-assisted method was used to perform these measurements. The radiographs were originally DICOM and transformed into TIFF greyscale format without compression. These digital images were processed via Roman v1.7 software (Roman software version V1.70; Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital, Oswestry, UK; http://www.cookedbits.co.uk/roma n/). Roman is a radiological measurement program designed for orthopaedic applications in general. Its accuracy has already been demonstrated for the measurement of polyethylene wear, where the determination of bone and prosthesis landmarks is automated by the computer using an edge detection algorithm [13]. Roman has also been successfully used in stem migration analyses [14].",

The distance was calculated using the procedure adopted by Nichols (2003) with the tool ArcGIS ArcMap 10.0 (ESRI 2010). The motivation for using these types of tools comes from the argument that when the data's spatial distribution is related to the phenomena occurring in the territory, one has a modern way to clarify questions related to various fields of knowledge (Ebner et al. 2009). The use of these techniques in the business field is in an embryonic stage (Goodchild 2010), especially in studies of collaborative phenomena (Sui et al. 2013). In addition, geographical information systems (GISs) could be a tool toward providing a spatial explanation of governance, population and cultural assets (Redaelli 2012).",

                    "full_context": "A shotgun metagenomics approach was applied on all three size fractions of four samples from Lakes Cis\u00f3 and Banyoles C-III. Identical reads were removed using CD-HIT (Li and Godzik, 2006). Annotation of metagenomic reads was conducted through the JCVI prokaryotic annotation pipeline (Tanenbaum et al., 2010) using Uniref100, PFAM, TIGRfam and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) Orthologs (KO) databases for taxonomic and functional annotation. JCVI Metagenomics reports (http://jcvi.org/metarep) were used for analysis and comparative metagenomics (Goll et al., 2010). KO annotation was used for functional analysis and KO counts were normalized according to the length of the read and the length of the target gene (Sharon et al., 2009). The communities and functional profiles found in each size fraction were highly similar (Supplementary Figure S1) and, therefore, we pooled all reads after normalizing for sequencing depth for subsequent analyses, which allows for a better comparison of metagenomes. The functional analyses focused on the three main biogeochemical cycles for this type of lakes, that is, carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) cycling. The genetic potential of the microbial community was analyzed following the C, N, and S marker genes (KOs) as reported by Lauro et al. (2011) with a few modifications. We amended this previous rubric by adding the anaerobic carbon fixation carried out through the Calvin cycle by Chromatiaceae, and additional genes for polysulfide reduction, nitrate reduction and nitrite oxidation. In addition, the genes pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (porA/B) were not considered as marker genes for fermentation as in Lauro et al. (2011), because they are key genes in the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle used for carbon fixation by Epsilonproteobacteria abundant in our study lakes (Campbell and Cary, 2004; Takai et al., 2005). Because both sulfide oxidation and dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathways are mediated by the same set of genes (aprA, aprB and dsrA) but are found in different families of bacteria, we assigned metagenomic reads to each pathway according to phylogeny, that is, sulfate reduction for Firmicutes and Deltaproteobacteria reads, and sulfide oxidation for Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Chlorobiaceae and Chromatiaceae. Finally, for the sulfur-oxidizing Epsilonproteobacteria of the order Campylobacterales we specifically searched for sox genes (coding for thiosulfate oxidation) not currently available in the KEGG database. Marker genes used in the present work are shown in Supplementary Table S1. Hierarchical clustering and heatmap plots were generated with R (R Development Core Team, 2012) using the library 'seriation'. Metagenomic data have been deposited at CAMERA (Sun et al., 2011) under accession number CAM_P_0001174.",

Eggs were harvested from females caught in the field in Okinawa as above, and 5 larvae were randomly chosen and reared at ambient temperature (approximately 27uC), each in a plastic columnar centrifuge tube with an airtight screw cap (10 mm in diameter and 50 mm in height) to prevent leaves from drying. The quantity of leaves eaten by each larva was monitored every day. One piece of leaf removed from the stalk was supplied at a time. Before being given to a larva, the leaf piece was weighed. Additionally, its image was taken by an image scanner, and its area was measured using the ImageJ 1.44p software (U. S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA, http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/, 1997-2012). After being eaten, the remaining leaf was replaced every day with a fresh leaf. The area of the remaining leaf was measured every day, and its value was converted into weight, based on the proportion of the original leaf represented by the remnant. This process ensured that the weight eaten each day was recorded as the weight of the fresh leaf.Cs value, 5.38 (60.06) 3 10 2 , was amended due to a typing error in the original paper 15. The same detector was used to measure cesium activity ( 137 Cs only) in pupae. This well-type detector provides maximum efficiency for small samples, because samples can be inserted into a well. Before measurement, dead pupae were air-dried for several months and placed in a columnar plastic container (14 mm in diameter). The detector was calibrated with a standard prepared from the NBL powder standard (New Brunswick Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy, Argonne, IL, USA). Measurements were performed until the error rate scored less than 10%. Measurements were assumed to be made simultaneously on 15 February 2014 for simplicity, although several days were required to obtain reliable levels of radioactive signals from the pupae. Radioactivity per pupa at the time of ingestion was calculated, assuming thatMortality and abnormality rates. The mortality rate was defined as the percentage of dead individuals at all stages relative to the total number of individuals reared. Thus, the mortality rate excluded only normal adults. In contrast, the abnormality rate reported here could be more accurately called the total abnormality rate. This rate was the percentage of dead individuals at the larval, prepupal, and pupal stages plus the adults that had morphological abnormalities relative to the total number of individuals reared. Thus, the abnormality rate excluded only normal adults that lacked any morphological abnormalities. Correlation analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel (2013) and JSTAT 13.0 (2012) (Yokohama, Japan).",

To date, 33 mutations have been identified in human Cx50; we summarize all reported mutations in Figure 3. The prevalence of changes in proline 88 indicates that this residue is a mutation hot spot. The p.P88T substitution changes a nonpolar residue to a polar residue at this key site in the protein. The online bioinformatics software SIFT (http://sift.jcvi.org/) predicts a deleterious effect of this substitution.

A complex problem is broken down into smaller, simpler problems with random solutions. These solutions are then evolved through the biologically mimicked process of variation and selection until the end condition is reached or a workable solution is generated. Thus, rgp is an implementation of GP methods in the R environment. 29 Package rgp results are simple representations of the problem without being exposed to a priori information. rgp offers various options for initialization, variation, and selection procedures inherent in GP. GP implements a tree structure representation to show the mathematical equations. The tree structure is composed of two parts: function set (nodes) and a terminal set (leaves). 30 The function set can be chosen through the operators {+, -, *, /, sin, cos, log, abs}, mathematical functions, conditional statements, or even the user-defined operators. In addition, the terminal set includes constants and model variables. 31,32 To find the best solution, different runs were conducted by iterating over GP tuning parameters. The most important tuning parameters are maximum size of the chromosome, the number of generations, and population size. 30 The size of the chromosome, which governs the maximum length of the equation, was varied from 5 to 100. The population size was set to 1,000, and the number of generations was set to 500 million evolution steps divided into 100 stages.",

To study this in detail, important features from both the data sets were compared. Feature selection experiments using fscaret were run independently on the external data set. Confirmatory models were developed with a variation of input vectors using the tree-based learning method Cubist. The resulting top features of the external data set are in agreement with the features used to train the models. The results confirm that the die compaction force is the most important variable, with roll compaction force, roll compaction tooling,percentage of material in the formulation, and granule fraction range displaying much lower ranking. Models developed without the information of roll compaction force, roll compaction tooling, and granule fraction range predict porosity of tablets accurately (Table 5: experiments with two and three inputs). The successful modeling shows that these variables do not contribute to the outcome within this design space. The results strongly suggest redundancies in the original data set, which, once removed, do not affect the prediction of porosity within the factor space. Correlation analysis of the original data set reveals that porosity is highly correlated to die compaction force (Figure 7).a nrMse and R 2 are presented. all experiments were done in 10cv mode of data representation.

The primer and probe sequences are reported in Supplementary Table  The duplex real-time PCR was executed as described above and in Armougom et al. 12 The specificity was tested on the DNA of the reference strains reported in Supplementary table 1. The stool-purified DNA was analyzed in samples that were pure, diluted at 1/10, and diluted at 1/ 100 to confirm the absence of inhibitors. Negative controls were included on each plate.

Participants were instructed to rest with their eyes closed during scanning. No participant reported falling asleep during the scan when routinely asked immediately after scanning. FMRI data were collected using a gradient-echo planar imaging sequence sensitive to BOLD contrast (TR = 2000ms, TE = 30ms, Diverse Amygdala-Frontal Connectivity in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder flip angle = 90\u00b0, FOV = 24 \u00d7 24cm, matrix = 64 \u00d7 64). Thirty-five axial slices were collected with 3-mm thickness without gap. For spatial normalization and localization, a 3-dimensional fast spoiled gradient-echo T1-weighted sequence was used to acquire high-resolution structural images (TR = 7.1ms, TE = 3.2ms, FOV = 24 \u00d7 24cm, matrix = 240 \u00d7 240, slice thickness = 1.0mm without gap, 176 slices, 1 averages). Image preprocessing was carried out using SPM5 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) and Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit (REST) (http:// www.restfmri.net). Preprocessing using SPM5 consisted of slice-time correction, motion correction, spatial normalization, and spatial smoothing full width at half maximum (FWHM = 6mm). Movement parameters were examined for each participant. Data sets with more than 2mm maximum translation in x, y or z, or 2\u00b0 of maximum rotation about 3 axes between each image were excluded. Preprocessing using REST consisted of removing linear drift through linear regression and temporal band-pass filtering (0.01-0.08 Hz) to reduce the effects of lowfrequency drifts and physiological high-frequency noise.",

It is an app for android phones called \"BPP @ MIT,\" available for download at the Google Play Store. 6 Every time a worker visits a store, she clicks on a button to open a new file. For the first product, she has to enter the store's name, zip code, and country. Then she scans the UPC barcode of the product (or the barcode on the price tag, depending on the particular retailer instructions provided), manually enters the price shown in the price tag next to the product (including all sales), marks the price as \"regular\" or \"sale,\" and takes a photograph of the price tag (which is used to detect errors and validate the data). All products are scanned in a loop which makes the process quick and simple. When done, the worker taps an icon to e-mail the data to the BPP servers. A member of the BPP team verifies the submitted data and pays the worker. 5 I tried to conduct a similar large-scale offline data collection with MIT students in the Boston area in 2011, but most of them were asked to stop and leave the stores after some time. Collecting data this way appears to be easier now that more people use smartphones inside stores. Indeed, Fitzgerald (2013) reports that the fear of showrooming has faded for many US retailers. See Balakrishnan, Sundaresan, and Zhang (2013) for an economic analysis of showrooming practices. 6 See https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mit.bpp. The app can be downloaded for free, but a \"project code\" must be requested from the BPP team. This code is used to separate the data from different projects. See http://bpp.mit.edu/ offline-data-collection/ for more details.Notes: These retailers satisfy three conditions. First, they are in the list of top 20 retailers by market share in their respective countries according to Euromonitor International. Second, they sell both online through a country-specific website and offline through physical stores. Third, there is a way to perfectly match products online and offline for the price comparison. See the online Appendix for more detailed characteristics and results.",

The new server detects miRNA targets in mRNA sequences of Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster and C.elegans. Furthermore, it has been updated to miRBase v18 (8) and Ensembl v69 (9). Specific attention has been paid to the web server interface, which follows the DIANA design framework, to be instantly familiar to users of previous versions, or other DIANA tools Figure 1). On the other hand, online help, informative tooltips and easy-to-use menus minimize the learning curve of new users. The fifth version of theDIANA-microT web server focuses also on advanced users and laboratories requiring support for sophisticated pipelines. The server provides programmatic access to services of multiple DIANA algorithms and a complete integration with the Taverna Workflow Management System (WMS) (10), using the in-house developed DIANA-Taverna Plug-in. Furthermore, a new section of the web interface hosts ready-made advanced workflows that can perform extensive miRNA-related analyses on results derived from high-throughput techniques, such as microarrays or Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS).",

Gene (9) and miRNA (13) expression annotation has been incorporated into the web server, enabling the user to perform advanced result filtering based on tissue expression. Furthermore, users can also restrict predictions between uploaded lists of expressed genes and/or miRNAs. For example, this feature can be used to identify interactions between a list of repressed (or overexpressed) genes and overexpressed (or repressed) miRNAs, in the case of a differential expression analysis pipeline. Moreover, the web server hosts an updated version of the KEGG database providing a relevant search module based on KEGG pathway descriptions (14).

This reflects not a judgment on the quality of high-throughput data, but a recognition that there are databases specifically designed to provide access to this data (11, 12, 13). However, while it does not lead directly to the construction of signaling cascades, information from high-throughput protein-protein interaction experiments can be useful in interpreting the curated pathways and assessing their completeness. For example, a high-throughput protein-protein interaction experiment can identify an unexpected binding partner for a catalyst, suggesting the possibility that the in vivo presence of the partner can sequester the catalyst and thus turn off downstream interactions. In the future, PID will allow users to take advantage of high-throughput protein-protein interaction data, either by allowing users to upload interaction sets to be added to the novel networks created by PID queries or by querying other data sources (such asPathway Commons, http://pathwaycommons.org) as needed to support a user query. The PID data model is currently being integrated with NCI's Cancer Bioinformatics Infrastructure Objects model (caBIO) (14), thereby making PID data accessible on NCI's caGrid (15).",

This method has been proved to be very effective in interpreting the functional similarities of genes based on gene annotation information from heterogeneous data sources (42 , 43 ). In our study, the semantic similarity between the molecular functions or the biological processes of two proteins involved in a PPI was calculated following the literature (43 ) and only those PPIs with a high semantic similarity value of 4.0 or more (5.5 being the highest) were used to create interaction networks under each GO term category.",

Under these growth conditions, in central China both semi-winter and winter types are generally sufficiently vernalized to flower after winter. Spring type accessions grown under these conditions do not usually start flowering before the onset of winter. During the winter months, plant growth slows down or comes to a halt, but the relatively mild winter temperatures at the chosen location in central China generally allows the spring types to survive as well. Flowering time in both field trials was recorded as the days from sowing to the date when the first flower had opened on half of the plants of an accession. Furthermore, accessions were classified as spring, semi-winter or winter types according to the annotation of the original cultivars (Chinese Crop Germplasm Information System (CGRIS), http://icgr.caas.net.cn/cgris_english.html) or their general performance in the field (see Supplementary Table S (Sambrook et al., 1989). DNA of positive BAC clones was extracted using the NucleoBond\u00d2 PC 500 plasmid DNA purification kit (Macherey & Nagel GmbH & Co. KG, D\u00fc ren, Germany). Sequence identity or homology to the probe fragment was confirmed by PCR amplification and sequencing of BAC DNA using primer pair A102-A103. The BAC clones were grouped into three sequence groups according to a multiple sequence alignment using the AlignX module of the Vector NTI software package (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, USA). To identify the full-length genomic sequences, one BAC of each group was selected for primer walking using primers A127, A133, A201, A248, A249, A250, A260, A261, A262, A372, and A378 (see Supplementary Table S2 at JXB online).

Orthology was inferred by bidirectional best hit analysis (Overbeek et al., 1999) using the B. napus genes as queries for BLASTX searches against the A. thaliana protein database at TAIR (http://www. arabidopsis.org). Following the nomenclature for Brassica genes (Ostergaard and King, 2008), the three FRI homologues were designated as BnaA.FRI.a, BnaX.FRI.b, and BnaX.FRI.c.",

(2009) which were distributed equally across the genetic map of B. napus. To reduce costs, an M13-tailing PCR technique was used (Schuelke, 2000). For each SSR primer combination, the forward sequence of the M13 primer was added to the 5# end of the forward SSR primer and the reverse sequence of the M13 primer was added to the 5' end of the reverse SSR primer. PCR reactions were performed with four primers, the M13F-forward SSR primer, the M13Rreverse SSR primer, an IRD700-labelled M13F primer (MWG Operon, Ebersberg, Germany) and an unlabelled M13R primer. The 28 SSR markers were used to assay the 95 accessions which were selected for the first round of genotyping. The DNA analyser system Li-Cor 4300 (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) was used for electrophoresis and detection of PCR products. The presence or absence of PCR product bands was scored as 1 or 0, respectively. The software STRUCTURE 2.2.3 was used to estimate population structure (http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu/ structure.html) (Pritchard et al., 2000). K values ranging from 1 to 10 were tested with a burn-in of 100 000 iterations and 100 000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations according to the software's instructions.",

                    "full_context": "Consistent with the phase relationships in the QTL population, the BnaA.FRI.a allele in the parental accession Ningyou7 corresponds to the earliest flowering haplotype 4, whereas the Tapidor allele corresponds to the latest flowering haplotype 3. Although there are several nonsynonymous SNPs within haplotype block 2, including the htSNP at position 1790 which shows a SNP-trait association in one year (P\u00bc0.017 in 2008; Table 2) and could possibly affect protein function, the protein sequence in this region is identical between the two extreme haplotypes 3 and 4. However, the two haplotypes differ at two positions at the nucleotide sequence level, i.e. the htSNP at position 1615 and the SNP at position 1702, which are both located within the coding sequence. In addition to the SNPs observed between haplotypes 3 and 4, the two alleles in the TNDH population carry multiple additional polymorphisms, including several SNPs and a 3 bp indel in the promoter region, two indels in the 5# UTR and six nonsynonymous SNPs in exon 1 (see Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online). Among the six non-synonymous SNPs, two are located within the Frigida domain, but not at positions which are conserved among FRI family I proteins in A. thaliana and other rosid species (Risk et al., 2010), and two are located in the non-conserved region between the Frigida domain and the N-terminal putative coiled-coil domain. The remaining two non-synonymous SNPs are located within the N-terminal putative coiled-coil domain. One of these SNPs (SNP254) results in the substitution of a charged residue (glutamate) by an uncharged amino acid (glycine). Charged residues are present at high percentages in coiled-coil domains and are thought to stabilize the domain through electrostatic interactions (McFarlane et al., 2009). Interestingly, a glutamate to glycine substitution in the winter type allele in Tapidor (in an otherwise unchanged, theoretical molecule) would reduce the probability of a coiled-coil domain in the N-terminal region from ;50% to <5%, and the probability of a coiled-coil domain in the semi-winter type allele in Ningyou7 is also low (<10%; predictions according to COILS for a window size of 28 residues; http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/coils/ COILS_doc.html; data not shown). The glutamate residue is conserved between A. thaliana and the Tapidor allele and corresponds to the position with the most significant P value for SNP-trait association within the entire gene (0.005 in 2009; Table 2). Furthermore, it was recently demonstrated that the N-terminal region including the coiled-coil domain of FRI in A. thaliana is required for protein-protein interaction with FRL1 as part of a transcriptional activator complex which establishes an active chromatin state of FLC (Choi et al., 2011). It is conceivable that the polymorphism within the N-terminal coiled-coil domain in BnaA.FRI.a contributes to functional differences between the segregating alleles in the TNDH population and may also play a part in natural variation at least in some environments.",

In the first case, no one opposes the establishment of the rule of law, and reform occurs in period 1. In the second case, three-fourths of the agents oppose the rule of law, and reform is delayed on average for 16 periods. 24 Figure 5(b) depicts the growth paths of agents\u00d5 expected aggregate lifetime income in these two cases. 25 Expected aggregate income is 20% lower along the path of delayed reform. Every agent is strictly worse off. 20 As emphasised by Greif (1994), culture is an equilibrium selection device and so it is interesting to consider within this model the role that culture might have played in Russia. Two facts suggest that the \u00d4good\u00d5 corner equilibrium, with x \u00c3 \u00bc 0, would not be a focal point: (a) managers commonly engaged in asset stripping well before the mass privatisation of 1992-4 (Grigoriev, 1992) and (b) most beneficiaries of the mass privatisation of large state enterprises in Russia were the managers. For instance, Varese (2001, Appendix B), finds in his survey of one Russian city in 1993 that 51% of the 92 full-time officials of the Communist Party in 1988 were top managers of economic enterprises. 21 We discuss other comparative statics results in Hoff and Stiglitz (2004a). 22 Or, more accurately, if the intersection of h \u00c3 (x; k) and the stripping ability curve lies along h a , not h p . 23 f \u00bc 0.05, I L \u00bc 0.01, I N \u00bc 0.0475,g \u00bc 1:05,z \u00bc 0:9, k \u00bc 0.3, and d \u00bc 0.945. Using (4), these values imply h max \u00bc 0.8. The EXCEL program is available at http://www.econ.worldbank.org/staff/khoff. 24 One can show by standard methods that given a transition probability p per period, the expected number of periods before reform is 1/p.

It is well known that the combination of nucleic acid and amino acid sequence information leads to improved alignments (9,10). The same situation holds for non-coding RNA genes. The spatial structure evolves slower than its primary structure. So puresequence-based multiple alignment tools perform poorly on low-homology datasets of structural RNAs (11). In this article, we present the MAGNOLIA website, whose objective is to provide an advanced tool for aligning nucleic acid sequences. The idea is to get rid of the dichotomy between aligning and predicting the function. If we assume that sequences are either protein-coding or structural RNAs, it is possible to incorporate some functional information into the alignment algorithm to improve the result. The multiple alignment can then be used as a starting point to refine the comparative analysis or to carry out further predictions, such as motif finding or phylogeny reconstruction.",

The basic schema of the database has changed dramatically, and the new database version unifies all sub-databases by reassigning the measured peptides along with their corresponding data from each experiment to protein entries of an updated database version. The new architecture is based in part on concepts developed for the Phosphorylation Site Database [PHOSIDA; www.phosida.com (14,15)]. It allows the organism-specific retrieval of various cell-type and organelle associated proteomic data. The user can query the database organism-specifically by protein name, protein description, gene symbol, accession of the database used for identification [such as the International Protein Index (IPI) ( 16)], SwissProt accession identifier, protein sequence or peptide sequence (Figure 1, left panel). If more than one protein entry matches with the submitted query string, MAPU 2.0 will list all relevant proteins and mark the ones identified in at least one proteomic experiment, in red (Figure 1, middle panel). Clicking on one of the red highlighted entries leads to the result page (Figure 1, right panel). If there is just a single match to the query, the web user will be guided directly to the result page describing the inquired protein. The left panel of the resulting web page displays investigated cell types and tissues. If the protein was detected in a certain sub-proteome, the corresponding button is highlighted (Figure 1, right panel). Otherwise, the image of the tissue or cell type is illustrated in light colors indicating the absence of the specified protein of interest. Clicking on one of the buttons on the left panel results in the complete listing of all peptides that have been measured in the selected cell type along with associated data such as peptide identification scores or identification scores for post-translational modifications (PTMs) (Figure 2).",

The cDNA was then directionally cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the Uni-ZAP XR vector (Stratagene). Single and well-separated plaques were cored out from agar plates and transferred to 96-well microtiter plates containing SM buffer. The phage stocks were used as templates for cDNA insert amplification with T3 and T7 primers (1 nM for each primer). The amplified products were separated in 1.5% agarose gels, and clones that yielded single polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified bands were collected for sequencing. Single-pass sequencing from the 5 0 -end of the cDNA insert was initiated with a T3 primer using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). The sequencing products were resolved and analysed on an ABI PRISM 377 (Applied Biosystems) or a MEGABACE DNA Sequencer (GE).

Whenever possible we then used the Anatomy ToolBox (Eickhoff et al., 2007) or the AAL atlas of the WFU Pickatlas (Maldjian et al., 2003) for regions not yet included in the Anatomy ToolBox and then combined them into a single composite anatomical region of interest using a logical 'OR' (Fig. 2, blue transparent regions). These anatomical regions, defined using Anatomy ToolBox included the premotor cortices (Brodmann area 6 in Anatomy ToolBox) (Gazzola and Keysers, 2009; Caspers et al., 2010), the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices (SI = BA3a + b + BA1 + BA2 and SII = OP1 + OP2 + OP3 + OP4) (Keysers et al., 2010). Those defined using the AAL included the insula and the anterior/mid cingulate (Wicker et al., 2003; Singer et al., 2004, 2006; Jabbi et al., 2007; Bastiaansen et al., 2009; Lamm et al., 2011). (ii) We used the results from our localizer experiment (i.e. experience) to select voxels that were significantly activated by at least one of our stimuli by either one of the groups (Fig. 2, red transparent regions). Eight one-sample random effect t-tests, comparing the four summary volumes (love, pain, neutral, exclusion) of the controls and those of the patients against zero (P unc 5 0.001), were combined by a logical 'OR' (Marsbar;http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/) to generate a composite functional region of interest. We combined all hand interactions into a single region of interest, because empathic responses in the viewer are not always equal to the emotion in the actor; seeing pain can trigger tender feelings in addition to, or instead of, pain. Using a composite functional region of interest that included voxels triggered by any of the experiences (love, pain, exclusion or neutral), ensured an inclusive analysis that also captured empathic responses that are not equal to the viewed emotions: tender feelings triggered by a pain video would be captured by such a composite functional region of interest, because similar tender feelings will have been triggered by the love interactions also included in the region of interest definition. The same holds for pain triggered by the sight of exclusion etc. (iii) A logical 'AND' was used to combine the composite functional and anatomical regions of interest (Fig. 2, purple transparent regions) leading to our final region of interest.",

This pattern is disrupted in the first kelch repeat of all three cyclostome proteins where the first glycine (\"G\") is replaced by an alanine residue (\"A\"). Another nonconserved site is a phenylalanine (\"F\") instead of a tyrosine (\"Y\") in the fourth kelch repeat of the chicken ENC3 protein. Because of similar physiochemical properties, these substitutions do not necessarily prevent the characteristic folding of the mature protein and thus its cellular function. Interestingly, the first kelch repeat of all vertebrate ENC proteins lacks the tryptophan residue and thus does not show the described motif. (B) A phylogenetic tree of the three ENC subgroups of jawed vertebrates, three cyclostome homologs, and the Branchiostoma floridae gene \"XP_002612442\" as outgroup is shown. Support values are shown for each node in order, bootstrap probabilities in the ML tree inference, and Bayesian posterior probabilities. Analysis is based on 311 amino acids, and the JTT + I + F + \u00c0 4 model was assumed (shape parameter of gamma distribution a \u00bc 0.66). Red arrows denote sequences that are newly reported in this study. For accession IDs of amino acid sequences used in this analysis, see supplementarySea lamprey P. marinus ENC-A was predicted in the AUGUSTUS web server (http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/ webaugustus/prediction/create, last accessed July 24, 2013) with its species-specific parameters on the supercontig22564 in the version 3 assembly of the genome sequencing project (PMAR3.0). An ORF of the gene designated P. marinus ENC-A was curated (for sequence see supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online). A truncated fragment of this gene is also present in Ensembl release 64 (ENSPMAG00000008371). The second lamprey ENC gene (ENC-B) is available in Ensembl version 64 (ENSPMAG00000000574). Because of unresolved orthology of these lamprey ENC genes to gnathostome ENC1-3, we refer to them as PmENC-A and PmENC-B.",

This tool allowed a higher accuracy, precision and strand specificity of the QmRLFSbased predictions of the R-loops in the proximal promoter and downstream transcription termination site regions (7,20). Soon after the publication of the R-loopDB, the DNA:RNA immune-precipitation coupled to highthroughput sequencing (DRIP-seq) data became available (9,23). Ginno et al. (9) have improved the initial DRIP-seq method (23) and reported detection of 4181 RNA:DNA hybrid regions. In (22), we reported that RLFS predicted byQmRLFS-finder overlapped with 79.2% of DRIP-seq regions defined by Ginno et al. (9). In a comparison of the frequencies of experimentally defined R-loops with those RLFSs predicted by QmRLFS-finder, our tool showed 91% accuracy, 94% sensitivity and 75% specificity (22).",

Plasma proteins on the surface of liposomes were quantified by densitometric analysis with the ImageJ software Version 1.45 (imagej.en.softonic.com/). The most abundant protein bands were cut and treated as previously described. 29,30 Briefly, each band was de-stained by washing in acetonitrile and 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Then, cysteine residues of the proteins were reduced in 10 mM dithiothreitol for 1 hour at 57\u00b0C, and alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide for 45 minutes at room temperature in the dark. Proteins were in situ digested using Porcine Trypsin Sequencing Grade (Promega Corporation, Fitchburg, WI, USA) overnight at 37\u00b0C at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:50. The next day, the supernatant was collected and larger peptides were extracted by adding acetonitrile to the bands. Enzyme activity was stopped by adding 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were recovered from the supernatant after centrifugation at 18,000\u00d7 g for 10 minutes. The resulting peptides were extracted and identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.",

The same as other protocols operating with position-specific weight matrices, PlatProm has an advantage of predicting transcription start points (TSP) (the main promoter attribute, which is determined experimentally), rather than to define promoter regions as extensive genomic loci (9,10,15,16). Upon scanning PlatProm considers any nucleotide as a probable point of transcription initiation and scores this probability by searching for promoter-specific elements in proper positions. Rather high precision and low rate of false positives made our software suitable for genome scanning, providing a possibility to compare in silico and in vivo data. In the present work, we describe an overall map of TSPs predicted byPlatProm; evaluate the degree of correlation betweenPlatProm scores and RNAPol-binding efficiency registered by two independent research groups (12,13); focus attention on intragenic TSPs and promoter 'islands' having high density of transcription signals over long distance; and verify capacity of one 'island' to bind RNAPol and initiate RNA synthesis.",

For example, Warren et al. 25 uncovered 38 895 intergenic open reading frames (ORFs), readily identified as putative genes by similarity to currently annotated genes, from 1297 prokaryotic replicons based on across-genome alignment. New genes could be confirmed by the similarity alignment or by transcription or proteome analyses. In this work, we first used the ZCURVE 26 program, which is freely available at http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/Zcurve_B/, to pick out all candidate genes that did not have same 5 0 terminals with all genes in the original annotation. The candidate may overlap one annotated gene with their sequences but they did not correspond to the same reading frame. Then those candidate new genes would be filtered by blast 27 against the NCBI nr database. If one candidate met the following three conditions, it would be regarded as genuine genes: (i) it had the significant similarity (E-value , 10 220 , Coverage . 60% and Identity . 50%) with annotated genes in bacteria beyond the same genus in the database, and it had the similar length with the counterpart (difference , 20%); (ii) it had counterpart in the cluster of orthologous groups (COG) database, i.e. it could be assigned within an existed COG cluster; (iii) it did not overlap annotated genes with any bases or it had a smaller E-value and a higher identity score against functional genes in the other genomes in the case of overlapping. This process has been standardized in this work. For each of the 10 strains, all parameters in the whole process were fixed.",

The dependent variable in each case is the natural logarithm of annual taxable earnings, and the explanatory variables are race, level of education, age and agesquared. Table 1 presents the estimation results for the race and education coefficients based on the various estimators. The first column, headed OLS1, contains the ordinary least squares estimates based on all of the data. The second column, headed OLS2, presents the least squares results using only the observations that are not censored. The third column contains the Tobit maximum likelihood estimates under the assumption that the errors are normally distributed and homoskedastic. The remaining columns present the results for the three semiparametric estimators: CLAD, SCLS and ICLAD. The Tobit, CLAD and SCLS estimators were implemented using the Stata software package, while the ICLAD estimator was calculated using the Gauss package. For each estimator, we have created Stata \"ado\" files that are available at \u0357http://elsa.berkeley.edu/\u03f3kenchay\u0358. 8 It is clear from Table 1 that the least squares and maximum likelihood estimates of the black-white log-earnings gap and the returns to education are extremely biased when compared to the semiparametric estimators. We think of the CLAD estimator as the natural benchmark, since it is consistent under the normality of errors assumption justifying the maximum likelihood estimator, under the independence of errors assumption justifying the ICLAD estimator, and under the conditional symmetry of errors assumption justifying the SCLS estimator. When compared to the CLAD benchmark, the least squares estimator based on all of the data (OLS1) actually does better than the maximum likelihood estimator. For this application, it appears that misspecifying the errors as being normally distributed and using maximum likelihood estimation results in more biased estimates than ignoring the censoring problem entirely and using least squares estimation. A more formal test of the normality assumption also suggests that it is violated for the log-earnings model. 9 There are sizeable differences in the estimated effects of education on earnings across the three semiparametric estimators. While the ICLAD and SCLS estimators of the education premium are similar, they are always greater than the CLAD estimator. These differences are significant given the precision of the estimates and range from 17 percent to 43 percent for the ICLAD estimator and 9 Chay and Honor\u00e9 (1998) calculate the test statistics for nonnormality and for heteroskedasticity in censored regression models discussed by Chesher and Irish (1987). The test statistic for detecting nonnormality ranges from 900.47 to 1200.68. Under the null, this statistic has an (asymptotic) 2 (2) distribution with a 1 percent critical value of 9.21. Therefore, we easily reject the hypothesis that the errors are normally distributed. The test for heteroskedasticity yields statistics between 84.71 and 90.85. Under the null, these have (asymptotic) 2 (12) distributions with a 1 percent critical value of 26.22. We therefore also reject the null of no heteroskedasticity.20 percent to 33 percent for the SCLS estimator. The differences in the estimates of the black-white earnings gap are smaller, with the CLAD estimator about 11 percent to 28 percent and 4 percent to 18 percent smaller in magnitude than the ICLAD and SCLS estimators, respectively. Strikingly, the semiparametric approaches all result in more precise estimates of the race coefficient than maximum likelihood estimation. For example, the standard errors of the CLAD estimator are 25 percent to 55 percent smaller than the standard errors of the Tobit estimator. 10 The differences in the coefficient estimates across the various estimators can be used as a sort of specification check, similar in spirit to the Newey (1987) specification analysis mentioned earlier. For the education coefficient, the large differences between the maximum likelihood and semiparametric estimates suggest that nonnormal errors are an important source of bias in the Tobit estimator. Further, the significant differences among the semiparametric estimates imply that heteroskedasticity and asymmetry of the errors are also sources of misspecification in the maximum likelihood estimator of the education premium. Conversely, for the black-white earnings gap, the smaller differences among the semiparametric estimates suggest that nonnormality is the biggest source of bias in the Tobit estimator, with heteroskedasticity and asymmetry playing smaller roles.",

SVM is a supervised machine learning method for data classification that can be trained to find the best hyperplane that separates all data points in two userdefined classes and can subsequently be exploited to blindpredict the class to which a new observation belongs (37-39). We defined two classes: mutated (heterozygous and null) and wild-type (males and females) mice. By using the Matlab function svmtrain, we trained the SVM with a subset of data consisting of 50% of the dataset and we than used the remaining 50% for testing, using the svmclassify function. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and D-prime (d 0 ) were then computed for the categorical classification in order to evaluate its performance. This procedure was repeated 200 times, each one with a randomly divided training and testing subsets. Values for accuracy, sensitivity (or true positive rate), specificity (or true negative rate) and d 0 were averaged across iterations. Accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were defined as (TP \u00fe TN)/total, TP/P and TN/N, respectively, where TP: True positive, TN: True Negative, P: total positives, N: total negatives.

                    "full_context": "One of the merits of LeSage & Pace's book is that they offer another criterion to select models, namely the Bayesian posterior model probability. Whereas tests for significant differences between log-likelihood function values, such as the LRtest, can formally not be used if models are non-nested (i.e. based on different spatial weights matrices), Bayesian posterior model probabilities do not require nested models to carry out these comparisons (p. 162). The basic idea is to set prior probabilities equal to 1/S, making each model equally likely a priori, to estimate each model by Bayesian methods, and then to compute posterior probabilities based on the data and the estimation results of this set of S models. Although the mathematics of this approach might deter potential users (Chs 5 and 6), my experience with this approach is positive. First, posterior model probabilities may differ widely even if the estimation results appear to be quite robust to different specifications of the spatial weights matrix. In a study I did on cross-country differences in governance (Seldadyo et al., 2010), the posterior model probability of a 10 nearest-neighbour matrix appeared to be more than six times as large as that of an inverse distance matrix, more than three times as large as that of a five nearestneighbour matrix, and more than twice as large as an inverse distance matrix with a cut-off point. Second, since Matlab routines applying Bayesian methods to the spatial lag, spatial error and spatial Durbin models are made downloadable for free on LeSage's website (www.spatial-econometrics.com), these kinds of comparisons can be carried out relatively easily. Furthermore, since LeSage also provides Matlab routines applying the Bayesian method to the spatial lag, spatial error and spatial Durbin models of limited dependent variables, similar types of selection procedures as discussed in this and the previous sections can be used for empirical problems requiring a probit or tobit approach (Ch. 10).",

                    "full_context": "E2F7 is a direct target of miR-26a and is upregulated in AML. We previously showed that miR-26a negatively regulates cell proliferation and stimulates myeloid differentiation of AML cells. 17 Notably, miR-26a negatively regulates G 1 /S transition in different tumors and this has been attributed, at least in part, to the direct regulation of EZH2 by miR-26a. 16,17,19,21 However, we showed that EZH2 is not a direct target of miR-26a in AML cells. 17 Thus, we decided to investigate novel relevant targets for miR-26a function in AML. Between the putative targets of miR-26a, we noticed the E2F7 transcription factor (data from TargetScan (www.targetscan.org) and Pictar (pictar.mdc-berlin.de)), an important regulator of the G 1 /S-phase transition. 23 The 3'-untranslated region (3 0 -UTR) of E2F7 contained two highly conserved putative binding sites for miR-26a (Figure 1a). To show the direct targeting of E2F7 by miR-26a, we constructed luciferase reporters containing the wild type (WT) 3 0 -UTR of E2F7 (WT), the E2F7 3 0 -UTR mutated at the miR-26a binding site I (Mut1), the E2F7 3 0 -UTR mutated at the miR-26a binding site II (Mut2) or the E2F7 3 0 -UTR mutated at both miR-26a binding sites (Mut1-2). Luciferase reporters were individually co-transfected in HeLa cells with a plasmid expressing miR-26a or control (Figure 1b). The expression of WT reporter was significantly decreased by miR-26a compared with control. Reporter Mut1 behaved similarly to WT, while deletion of Mut2 partially relieved translational repression. On the other hand, expression of the reporter construct mutated at both miR-26a binding sites of E2F7 3 0 -UTR (Mut1-2) was not sensitive to miR-26a translational repression. This may be explained by the fact that the binding of miR-26a on site II increases the accessibility to site I or, alternatively, binding of one repressive complex on site II may serve as scaffold for attracting cofactors necessary for repression on site I. These results demonstrated that miR-26a regulated E2F7 expression through direct binding of the 3 0 -UTR. To further demonstrate that miR-26a represses E2F7 expression in AML, U937 cells were infected with a lentivirus containing an miR-26a expression cassette (Lenti-26a) or control (Mock inf.). Enforced expression by lentiviral transduction significantly increased miR-26a levels with a concomitant decrease in E2F7 protein levels (Figure 2a). Similar results were obtained with the HL-60 cell line (Supplementary Figure 1). Altogether, these data indicated that E2F7 is a direct target of miR-26a in AML.",

We converted the raw sequencing SRA data to FASTQ format using 'fastq-dump' version 2.3.4 in the sequence read archive (SRA) Toolkit (26). We aligned the reads to the S. cerevisiae reference genome (sacCer2) using Bowtie 2 (27) version 2.2.1 with default parameters and then converted the sequence alignment / map (SAM) output to binary alignment / map (BAM) format using SAMtools (28) version0.1.19-44428cd. We filtered the sequencing reads (using the R package 'ShortRead' (29) version 1.20.0 with a custom filter) to retain only those with two or less expected errors per read: given a Phred quality score q for each base call, the probability that a base call is erroneous is P = 10 (\u2212 q / 10) , which is then summed over the bases in the read to give the expected errors per read. Using 'ShortRead' (29), we deduplicated the reads to control for PCR amplification bias (30,31) and masked the highly repetitive chromosome XII rDNA region (via a custom filter) because of the difficulty of aligning short reads there. We log 2 -normalized each ChIP-seq sample to the mock IP control using the function get.smoothed.enrichment.mle() in the R package 'spp' (32) version 1.11 with a 200 basepair (bp) bandwidth and 100 bp stepsize.

                    "full_context": "Currently, there exist three different predictors publicly available: big-\u03c0 (15 ) from the University of Vienna (available in two versions, one for metazoa and one for protozoa), DGPI from the University of Geneva (retrieved from http://129.194.185.165/ dgpi/), and the large-scale annotator GPI-SOM (16 ) from the University of Bern. The first two also predict potential cleavage sites while the third does not. These tools target the C-terminal and N-terminal signals of protein sequences, or require verifying the presence of the N-terminal signal before submitting sequences to the predictor. This affects automatically their performance in the presence of fragmented or partial sequences, which happen to be more and more common in databases. In particular, metagenome projects generate many fragmented sequences representing only partial proteins, complicating the annotation process. Moreover, with metagenome projects, the inability to relate many of the new sequences to a specific taxonomic group does not favor the use of a group-specific tool like big-\u03c0. Therefore, large-scale annotation tools, which are able to predict the presence of a particular motif at different levels of precision (that is, to assess each prediction in a qualitative way) with minimal information, are then needed to address this new reality, since tools that are too restrictive or specialized often lack the flexibility needed to make correct predictions. For example, a recent analysis of the P. falciparum proteome shows that big-\u03c0, DGPI, and GPI-SOM generated poor results in predicting proteins selected as biologically validated or highly probable candidates (14 ). Accordingly, our system was designed to offer the precision of cleavage site prediction tools and the flexibility needed for a large-scale annotator in a noisy environment.",

The choice of the length of the C-terminal section was based on an analysis of Swiss-Prot GPI-anchored proteins, which showed a maximum length of 45 a.a. for the C-terminal signal. To give some flexibility to the system, we selected an input vector of 50 a.a. Since neural networks accept numerical input, and given the importance of molecular weight and hydrophobicityin the anchoring process, we encoded each amino acid with its hydropathy on the Kyte and Doolitle scale (21 ), as well as its molecular weight. The last step is the normalization of the input vectors. We have applied a simple min-max normalization:",

                    "full_context": "Although improvements in computer gene-finding programs have made it relatively easy to detect genes in uncharacterized genomic DNA sequences, it remains difficult to determine how many exons and introns there are in a given sequence and what are the exact boundaries between them. As we know, gene identification methods may be classified as recognition of protein coding regions and recognition of functional sites of genes. In the past two decades, many new methods for finding distinctive features of protein coding regions have been presented, including the algorithms based on codon usage (1 ), dicodon usage (2 ), 3-base periodicity (3)(4)(5), and the fifth-order phase Markov chain model (6 ). Although great progress has been made, the situation is still far from being perfect. Undoubtedly, the fifth-order Markov chain model has a better identification accuracy, since this method makes full use of the local statistical characteristics of base distribution in three frames of coding sequences. However, it still has its shortcomings; the parameters determined based on previously discovered sequences cannot be applied to identify genes on different sequences with the same accuracy (7 ). Moreover, it needs a large data set to train the bulky parameters, whose number is nearly five thousand. In recent years, several new algorithms have been proposed, such as MZEF (8 ), GLIMMER (9 ), MOR-GAN  (10 ), GeneMark.hmm (11 ), GENESCAN (12 ), FGENESH (13 ), and so on (14 , 15 ). An up-todate list of references is maintained by Wentian Li (http://www.nslij-genetics.org/gene/; ref. 16 ). And a powerful gene finding program, BGF (Beijing Gene Finder), is proposed by Beijing Genomics Institute (http://bgf.genomics.org.cn/). These algorithms, which use both coding information and splicing signals, perform better than those using only splicing signals (17 ). However, there is still the need of new methods for gene prediction, which utilize features of gene structure that have so far not been incorporated into programs already available (7 ).",

                    "full_context": "To visualize the cortical representation of the regression weights, the minimum norm source localization technique was implemented inSPM 8 using the IID option. Instead of using the regression weights derived from MEG data averaged over participants (those used for model fit and classification), for source localization, we calculated the regression weights for each participant separately, that were then used as the inputs to the source localization procedure. These individual participant localizations were used to provide more accurate source reconstructions than those that localizing the grand averaged data would have produced. Since the regression weights are obtained using linear equations with standardized predictors, they can be used for source localization (Hauk et al. 2006). MRI images were segmented and spatially normalized to an MNI template brain in Talairach space. A template cortical mesh with 8196 vertices was inverse normalized to the individual's specific MRI space. MEG sensor locations were coregistered to MRI space using the fiducial and digitized head-points obtained during acquisition. The forward model was created using the single shell option to calculate the lead-fields for the sources oriented normal to the cortical surface. The data from both magnetometers and gradiometers were inverted together (Henson et al. 2009) to estimate activity at each cortical source using a minimum norm solution, where the inversion was performed simultaneously for all the regression weights for the epoch \u2212200 to 600 ms. No depth weighting was applied. The estimated cortical activity was averaged across the specified time windows (70-160 and 200-400 ms-see Results) before generating an image in MNI space (absolute regression coefficient values), which was smoothed with a 6-mm FWHM Gaussian smoothing kernel. This produces a cortical representation of the regression weights for each predictor, which were then averaged across participants, and displayed on an inflated cortex using Caret (http://www.nitrc.org/projects/caret/). The color scale used was defined by the maximum absolute regression coefficient over all time windows and conditions with no thresholds applied.",

Direct MTA targets could be of higher impact than the indirect signaling pathway in question. Oncogenes' alterations because of their impact on inducing cancer could be considered more deleterious than TSG alterations and consequently considered of higher impact in treatment algorithms. For example, when a tumor sample from a patient enrolled in a PM trial harbors an activating mutation of BRAF (V600E) and a homozygous deletion in PTEN, the inhibition of BRAF using vemurafenib should be considered of higher priority as compared with the use of an AKT or an mTOR inhibitor. An important criterion in prioritizing molecular alterations is also the presence of downstream resistance biomarkers. These data  review should be considered together with technical issues and thresholds (Table 5).",

We will present an algorithm and a corresponding MATLAB numerical toolbox which solves any form of an infinite-planning horizon affine linear quadratic open-loop differential game. The software, called LQDG Toolbox, is available as a freeware from the authors of this paper. 1 By rewriting a specific application into the standard framework, one can use the toolbox to calculate and verify the existence of both the open-loop non-cooperative Nash equilibrium (equilibria) and cooperative Pareto equilibrium (equilibria) of any infinite-planning horizon affine linear quadratic open-loop differential game. In case there is more than one equilibrium for the non-cooperative case, the toolbox determines all solutions that can be implemented as a state-feedback strategy that is a common assumption in most of the applications. 2 Alternatively, the toolbox can apply a number of choice methods in order to discriminate between multiple equilibria. For instance, one can choose to report only Pareto-undominated solutions or only those that are characterised by the lowest combined loss of all the players. In order to determine the cooperative solution, the user is asked to specify the relative importance of each player in the cooperative game. Moreover, the user can predefine a set of coalition structures for which they would like to calculate the noncooperative Nash solution(s). Conversely, a coalition structure generator is provided that automatically creates a whole space of coalition structures for a given number of players. Furthermore, the toolbox offers plotting facilities as well as other options to analyze the outcome of the game. For instance, it is possible to disaggregate each player's total loss into its contributing elements, which correspond to the quadratic expressions constituting the player's loss function.",

                    "full_context": "In the rest of this paper we will concentrate on the case that the players base their decisions on a performance criterion that has an infinite-planning horizon. We will present an algorithm and a corresponding MATLAB numerical toolbox which solves any form of an infinite-planning horizon affine linear quadratic open-loop differential game. The software, called LQDG Toolbox, is available as a freeware from the authors of this paper. 1 By rewriting a specific application into the standard framework, one can use the toolbox to calculate and verify the existence of both the open-loop non-cooperative Nash equilibrium (equilibria) and cooperative Pareto equilibrium (equilibria) of any infinite-planning horizon affine linear quadratic open-loop differential game. In case there is more than one equilibrium for the non-cooperative case, the toolbox determines all solutions that can be implemented as a state-feedback strategy that is a common assumption in most of the applications. 2 Alternatively, the toolbox can apply a number of choice methods in order to discriminate between multiple equilibria. For instance, one can choose to report only Pareto-undominated solutions or only those that are characterised by the lowest combined loss of all the players. In order to determine the cooperative solution, the user is asked to specify the relative importance of each player in the cooperative game. Moreover, the user can predefine a set of coalition structures for which they would like to calculate the noncooperative Nash solution(s). Conversely, a coalition structure generator is provided that automatically creates a whole space of coalition structures for a given number of players. Furthermore, the toolbox offers plotting facilities as well as other options to analyze the outcome of the game. For instance, it is possible to disaggregate each player's total loss into its contributing elements, which correspond to the quadratic expressions constituting the player's loss function.",

For parameter estimation and hypothesis testing the complementary combination of f requentist (orthodox) and Bayesian approaches was used. Nonparametric bootstrapping and permutation (Monte Carlo) procedures were realized with the number of replicates and/or random permutations as large as possible (but no less than 1 million).

Age and sex were modeled as covariates in all analyses. Similarly, we used analyses of variance to investigate autism versus control, control versus sibling and autism versus sibling differences, again taking age and sex as covariates. We investigated linear trend effects across the three groups using polynomial regression, and where a statistically significant linear effect was found, we examined the quadratic effect to confirm that this was nonsignificant.

                    "full_context": "All participants had demographic, BMI, waist-hip ratio, blood pressure and glucometabolic (cholesterol, triglycerides, BSL, HbA1c, oGTT and IV GTT) data collected at baseline. In addition, the renal transplant recipients had renal specific and transplant specific data collected pretransplant and at 3 and 12 months posttransplantation. As outlined in Figure 2, all patients had baseline IV GTT and oGTT tests. Results for glucose and insulin from multiple time points enabled the calculation of glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, insulin secretion and disposition index. Each test was conducted on a different day and after an overnight fast. The renal transplant recipients had these tests conducted within 2 months of renal transplantation. This group also had an IV GTT and oGTT conducted at 3 and 12 months posttransplantation. IV GTT was also performed on day 7 posttransplantation. Any recipient who had been commenced on a hypoglycemic agent had that agent withheld for 72 hours before each test. The oGTT test was conducted by administering 75 g of oral glucose and drawing a venous sample from an intravenous cannula placed in the cubital fossa of the nonarteriovenous fistula arm at 0, 30, 60 and 120 minutes. The IV GTT test was conducted by administering 0.3 mg/kg intravenous glucose to a maximum dose of 25 g, diluted in normal saline to a maximum volume of 100 mL. Venous samples were drawn from an intravenous cannula placed in the cubital fossa of the non-arteriovenous fistula arm at \u221210, \u22121, +2, +4, +6, +8, +10, +12, +14, +19, +25, +40 minutes. It has previously been established that this dose of intravenous glucose elicits the maximal pancreatic response over this period 21 and similar protocols have been successfully used. 22 Glucose metabolism was assessed by 2 different approaches. Firstly, a comprehensive descriptive analysis was aided by the area under the curve (AUC) of oGTT of each recipient at pretransplant, 3 and 12 months posttransplant. Secondly, an improved understanding of the pathophysiology was gained by assessing the first phase insulin release (FPIR), insulin resistance and \u03b2 cell responsiveness. FPIR is an index of the \u03b2 cell response to intravenous glucose (insulinogenic index) and was calculated using the IV GTT by FPIR = (AUC insulin t0-10 minutes)/(Glucose t0minutes \u2212 (Av(t-10 minutes and t-1 minutes)) as previously described. 23 Insulin resistance was determined using paired insulin and glucose results obtained from IV GTT, which were then applied to the homeostatic model assessment 2 (HOMA2) calculator, available from https://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/homacalculator/ download.php. This has previously been validated in ESKD patients. 24 Insulin sensitivity is the inverse of insulin resistance. The DI (IV) was calculated as the FPIR/insulin resistance. The DI (IV) is a measure of \u03b2 cell responsiveness and has been shown in the general population to bepredictive of the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in those at clinically increased risk. 25 Disposition index relates insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance in a hyperbolic relationship such that an increase an insulin resistance is associated with a compensatory increase in insulin secretion to maintain normoglycemia. 18 At the time of transplantation, recipients received 20 mg basiliximab on days 0 and 4, 500 mg intravenous methylprednisolone on day 0 followed by 30 mg daily of oral prednisolone which was weaned after 3 weeks by 2.5 mg every 2 weeks to a target dose of 5 mg daily. All recipients received 1 g twice a day of mycophenolate mofetil and a CNI, however, the choice of agent was at the discretion of the treating transplant physician. For those who received cyclosporin, the starting dose was 4 mg/kg twice a day with a C2 target of 1200 for the first month, 800 to 1000 at 3 months and 400 to 600 at 12 months. For those who received tacrolimus, the starting dose was 0.075 mg/kg twice a day with a trough tacrolimus target of 8 to 10 for the first month and 5 to 8 at 3 months. All recipients received protocol cytomegalovirus and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia prophylaxis. Renal transplant biopsies were conducted as protocol at 3 months or as indicated by clinical criteria. Acute cellular rejection was treated with oral prednisolone 300, 200, and 100 mg over 3 consecutive days. To comprehensively assess immunosuppression burden weekly therapeutic drug levels for CNI agents were collected and the cumulative exposure determined by calculating the AUC.",

                    "full_context": "Workflows and protocols: Mobyle already embeds a prototype dataflow-oriented workflow engine, enabling the chaining of successive or parallel tasks to be automated. It runs on top of theMobyle core library, exploiting the Mobyle network to execute tasks distributed between local and remote servers, and orchestrates the tasks to synchronize their execution with the availability of all their input data. Mobyle workflows modelize a set of tasks, but in contrast with existing workflow languages such as SCUFL in Taverna (Oinn et al., 2004) or MoML in Kepler (Altintas et al., 2004), do not specify explicitly some low-level data format detection and transformation tasks. Authors are, whenever possible according to local configuration, not asked to specify these steps. Hence, the storage of workflow definitions is planned to be based on an extension of the current Mobyle XML language, as they are based on a higher level perspective on the analyses they describe. An interesting outcome is the possibility to save an interactively designed program chaining as a reusable composite service. This perspective provides a gateway towards the publication of useracknowledged protocols on a community-based platform such as myexperiment.org (De Roure et al., 2007). Future end-user access to the workflow definitions and workflow engine will be integrated to the current web interface.",

The 20-Hz value is five times the maximum frequency present in foveation periods (0-2 Hz) and still allows separation of foveating and braking saccades from those periods. Analysis was always done on the fixating eye. Segments with inattention or blinking were discarded.",

In the OMtools software, we use the NAFX's graphical user interface for data selection and analysis (details can be obtained from http://www.omlab.org/ OMLAB_page/Teaching/Using_NAFX.html) [22]. The NAFX provides an objective and repeatable measure of nystagmus foveation quality that accurately predicts the bestcorrected visual acuity possible for subjects without afferent visual system defects, regardless of the eye-movement recording system, the nystagmus type, and waveforms [21]. In the absence of afferent deficits, the NAFX is highly correlated with measured acuity. We averaged the NAFX values if several were obtained at each gaze angle.",

Because of the diverse morphology of mitochondria, we plotted the coordinates of one end for longer organelles and the center of mass for shorter ones. Mitochondrial motility was expressed in terms of the displacement distances and velocities. To define fast organelle movements, we applied a threshold of 200 nm/s. The values of the relative motility of mitochondria were expressed as mean percentages of fast movements in all recorded displacements \u00b1 SEM. In each experiment, 20-40 individual mitochondrial movements were analyzed in each of 10-15 cells. The significance of differences was estimated statistically by the paired-sample Student's t test. Variability of the values calculated for different cells in the samples was analyzed by the same method and was insignificant.",

Sequence reads from the whole-genome libraries were aligned to the human reference genome (build GRCh37) using the Burrows-Wheeler alignment (BWA) tool (Li and Durbin 2010). The tumor's genomic sequence was compared with that of the patient's constitutive DNA to identify somatic alterations.

De novo assembly and annotation of genomic data using ABySS and Trans-ABySS (Simpson et al. 2009) were used to identify small insertions and deletions (indels) and large structural variants (SVs) including translocations, inversion, and duplications leading to gene fusions; identified SVs were verified using an orthogonal alignment-based detection tool, BreakDancer (Chen et al. 2009).

                    "full_context": "Tables 1 and Appendix Table 4 shows two major differences between the mergers we were able to examine and those that we excluded. First, overall, the excluded mergers took place in smaller markets. For instance, three of the 12 excluded mergers took place in very small markets (with fewer than 10 stores), and only one merger took place in a large market (Supervalu's purchases of the Jewel/Osco chain in Chicago). Second, in part because the excluded mergers took place in smaller markets, these markets tended to be more concentrated premerger. For example, Table 1 shows that three of the studied mergers studied took place in unconcentrated markets (with an HHI <1,500), while only one of the omitted mergers took place in an unconcentrated market. 31 To provide the reader with a sense of how the mergers affected market concentration in the regions located close to the merging firms' stores, we have also calculated the level and change of the HHI in the region immediately surrounding each of the merging firms' stores (defined as a 6-mile circle centered at the location of a store owned by one of the two merging firms). By construction, this technique generates as many \"local markets\" as there are stores owned by the merging firms. The online Appendix Table 4 presents descriptive statistics of the empirical distributions of the level and change in market concentration corresponding to each of the 14 studied mergers. Qualitatively, market concentration measured at the CBSA level and within the region immediately surrounding the affected stores were quite similar (with a correlation coefficient of 0.92). The level of market concentration (HHI) in the smaller regions tends to be larger than in the CBSA because (in most cases) fewer independent firms operate within subregions of a CBSA. 32 Most studies that exploit geographic variation in how mergers affect pricing using an identification strategy similar to ours. Examples include studies of mergers in the airline industry (Borenstein, 1990;Kim & Singal 1993), banking (Prager & Hannan, 1998;Focarelli & Panetta, 2003), gasoline refining and distribution (Taylor & Hosken 2007;Simpson &Taylor 2008), andhospitals (Haas-Wilson &Garmon 2011;Tenn 2011). 33 To our knowledge, the synthetic control estimator has not been used to estimate the price impact of mergers. 34 We use the Stata code developed by Sergio Correia (reghdfe.ado) available at https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s457874.html (last visited September 23,2016). 35 For the larger mergers we have been able to identify the dates the transactions closed, for example, A&P's merger with Pathmark. For smaller mergers, such as the transfer of ownership of a handful of stores in a small CBSA, we have not been able to identify the precise date the merger became effective. 36 Two of the mergers (in Evansville and Topeka) were consummated in the first half of 2008. For these transactions, we assume the effects of the merger are felt within 6 months. That is, pricing observed in 2009 represents how prices changed as the result of the merger. model. 50 The postmerger HHI is equal to the sum of the premerger HHI and the change in HHI shown in Table 1. 51 This can be more clearly seen in the figure in the appendix that plots the change in market concentration and the change in price (the analogue to Figure 2). 52 We have also examined the relationship between the postmerger level of concentration or change in concentration using alternative measures of market concentration, (e.g., market concentration measured within either 3 or 6 miles of a store owned by the merging firms). In all cases, we find qualitatively similar results to those shown in Figure 2: both the level of postmerger concentration and the change in concentration are positively correlated with the change in postmerger prices. However, only the level of postmerger concentration is statistically related to postmerger prices (at either the 5 % or 10% significance level). The results from this analysis are shown in online Appendix Table 7. 53 Antitrust economists have developed a number of techniques to measure the intensity of competition between competing retailers beyond market concentration to help identify which retailing mergers are most likely to be problematic (see Hosken & Tenn [2016]for a recent survey). 54 In related work, Hosken, Olson, and Smith (2016) examine the efficacy of using market entry and exit studies to forecast the likely competitive impact of horizontal mergers. Implicitly, this methodological approach assumes that the price impact of entry (exit) is the reverse of (the same as) a horizontal merger. That is, the estimated reduction in market prices following entry would be roughly the same magnitude (but opposite in sign) as a horizontal merger of similar size. Hosken, Olson, and Smith evaluate this methodological approach by estimating the price impact of market entry and exit in the supermarket industry. They conclude that studies of market exit are unlikely to inform merger analysis (more often than not market exit is associated with reductions in market price). Their findings for entry studies are more promising. Although the authors find evidence that the price impact of entry is biased down (in absolute value), overall, significant market entry appears to lower market prices. Moreover, when the authors compare the estimated price impact of entry to the estimated price effects of mergers found in this study, they note that they are of a similar magnitude. For this reason, Hosken, Olson, and Smith conclude that well-executed entry studies can provide useful information to aid antitrust enforcers in identifying potentially anticompetitive mergers.",

The relationship between the main and secondary outcomes and the effect of the intervention were examined with generalied linear mixed models (GLMM), accounting for clustering of patients within physicians. ORs for follow-up versus baseline within the two groups were calculated, adjusting for covariates that differed between baseline and follow-up patient populations; thus, the covariates included in these adjusted analyses included race, and clinical diagnosis of hypertension or depression. GLMM was implemented by PROC GLIMMIX in SAS and was adjusted for race, and clinical diagnosis of hypertension or depression. Thus, the group coefficient represented differences between the intervention and control groups at baseline; the time of coefficient represented changes in the control group over time, thus capturing temporal trends. Finally, the group-by-time interaction coefficient represented the difference-of-differences for over-time change in the intervention versus control group, and was a direct comparison of over-time change for the intervention versus the control group. A positive OR meant that the odds of a patient being in control increased more over time for the intervention versus control group. All analyses were performed in SAS V.9.2 (Cary, North Carolina, USA).",

However, until recently no such algorithm existed for reliably predicting the joint secondary structure of two interacting RNA molecules, or measuring the stability of such a joint structure. At SFU Lab for Computational Biology, we developed inteRNA the first program that aims to compute the joint structure prediction of two given RNA sequences through minimizing their total free energy, which is a function of the topology of the joint structure. The algorithmic foundations of inteRNA were introduced in (7).inteRNA aims to minimize the joint free energy under a number of energy models with growing complexity. Our default energy model is based mostly on stacked pair energies given by Mathews et al. (8)-the free energy model employed by Mfold. Because there is very little thermodynamic information on kissing loop sequences in the literature, inteRNA employs the approach used by Rivas and Eddy (9) to differentiate the thermodynamic parameters of 'external' bonds from the 'internal' bonds, i.e. we simply multiply the external parameters with a weight slightly smaller than 1. Note that the default algorithmic engine used by inteRNA requires substantial resources in terms of running time and memory which could be prohibitive for predicting joint structure of sufficiently long RNAs. Thus we made available an alternative heuristic engine that aims to capture the joint secondary structure of interacting RNAs. This heuristic approach is based on the observation that the substructures that are available independently in each RNA are mostly preserved in their joint secondary structure.",

As many novel regulatory RNA classes are being discovered, the determination of the exact functionality of all regulatory ncRNAs is one of the most significant scientific challenges to be tackled in the coming years. Our software tool pRuNA is developed for helping to address this challenge: it aims to identify all potential regulatory ncRNAs that can establish stable joint structures with a query mRNA (10). An important component of pRuNA is a sequence filter which eliminates a significant fraction of the available ncRNA collection and retains only the most likely ncRNA candidates for forming a stable joint structure with the query mRNA. We note that the majority of regulatory ncRNAs are only partially complementary to their target mRNA sequences. Typically these RNAs contain at least two short (5-7 nt) motifs on their loop structures that are complementary to the specific single-stranded locations in the target RNAs (11). Thus pRuNA first identifies all pairs of 5-mer motifs from the ncRNA loop sequences that are complementary to a pair of 5-mer motifs in the loop sequences of the query mRNA. The ncRNAs that include such 5-mer motif pairs are then tested against the query mRNA via the use of inteRNA and those which can establish stable joint structures are returned by the program.",

From Equation (10), we know that an increase in t A increases the relative domestic price of the imported good. This is the Metzler paradox, in which the imposition of a tariff on imports decreases the relative internal price of that good. Under the paradoxical price changes, an increase in tariff will necessarily increase real purchasing power for domestic consumers. 11 The Matlab code is downloadable in mwkang.site11.com/code/rie2016. 12 The Ricardian model introduced in this paper has a combination of effects that include expansion and contraction, so it is not obvious whether the condition oEX(a,a 0 )/oa < 0 clearly represents the immiserizing growth effect. To clarify this issue, it is worth presenting a simple model of endowment economy. With the same CES utility functions as in Equation 18, country A's endowment for good (x, y) is ffiffi ffi k p a; 0 \u00c0 \u00c1 and country B's endowment is 0; ffiffi ffi k p a 0 \u00c0 \u00c1 . In this endowment economy, there exists closed form solutions for the equilibrium allocations, and the condition for country A's welfare to decrease as a increases is that E < 0.5 for any value of a 0 > 0, a ! a 0 , and k > 0, which is the same as the condition in Equation (21).",

In the second part of interested students can participate in a voluntary online-POL seminar and deepen their knowledge. The first part allows students to revise the nuclear medicine seminars by providing the slides, sources and further references. In the second part interested students can participate in a voluntary online POL seminar and deepen their knowledge. This part of the offer was -because it is teaching project -deliberately designed to be passive; except for a forum and feedback tools there are no plans for interactive teaching at this level. The concept plans that moodle pages accompanying the seminar draw attention to the \"active offer\" (the POL area) and serve as a \"lure\". Therefore, the method of problem-oriented learning is described at the bottom of the page and the first POL case is made available on this page. Students interested in working on this POL case in a virtual seminar are asked to register by email to receive more information. Once there are at least 4 people interested in working on a POL case, a small group is formed. To conduct a virtual POL seminar, some basic technical knowledge or preparation is required from each participant. Due to the costs, a deliberate decision was made not to use virtual classrooms or a similar platforms. In our context the online communication software Skype (http:// www.skype.com) and the word processing application Google Docs (http://www.google.com/google-d-s/intl/de/ tour1.html) were used. Both programs available free of charge and are already used by many people in everyday life. While Skype provides the basis for the online meetings with conference calls, the application Google Docs has the advantage that a multitude of documents can be edited by different people, simultaneously or one-at-atime, so simple synchronous and asynchronous online collaboration is possible. For this purpose the tutors create an account and provide login information for the students. The case process is inspired by the classic POL principle, which means the starting point for the students is a real case study from nuclear medicine. To date, three cases have been completed dealing with thyroid diagnosis, oncological positron emission tomography (PET) and myocardial scintigraphy. As an example, the POL module \"Energised\" on thyroid diagnosis and treatment, including the background information for students and tutors, the intended learning goals and guidelines for online presentation is shown in the appendix . The case is worked upon -following the classical POL model [12] -in seven steps, which are carried virtually for the most part (online): The steps to clarify basic questions of understanding, defining the problem, the collection of ideas and approaches, the systematic ordering of ideas and approaches are made online in a Skype conference call under the moderation of a tutor (a specialist in nuclear medicine or a medical physics expert, each with at least 5 years of teaching experience but without dedicated training), which ends in the formulation of learning objectives. Subsequently, students work on their own or in groups to develop the learning content and compile the results in a document (text or slides). In this phase, slated to last up to three weeks maximum, the tutor is available by email or by telephone on weekdays to answer questions and problems and responds to questions/comments within 24 hours. Finally, the synthesis and discussion of the group results on the basis of the documents takes place online as well. A feedback session concludes the case discussion.",

Many AS events have been actively detected with high-throughput experimental methods, such as RNA-Seq and microarrays (Hallegger et al., 2010). However, the functions of putative proteins encoded by AS transcripts (termed 'AS isoforms') have not been experimentally analyzed in many cases. Functional annotation tools for transcripts with novel patterns of splicing are desirable to infer the functional significance of AS isoforms. There are few tools for analyzing AS isoforms translated from novel transcripts queried by users. AltAnalyze (http://www. altanalyze.org) identifies AS events using RNA-Seq or microarray data and shows how these events may affect domain composition. However, it does not provide information on the effects of AS on the 3D structures of AS isoforms. MAISTAS (Floris et al., 2011) assesses whether user-queried AS isoforms are structurally plausible proteins, but explicit functional annotations are not provided.",

An alignment of the query transcript and the contig sequence is performed using SPLIGN (Kapustin et al., 2008). AS-EAST searches the AS-ALPS database for transcripts mapped on the same region of the contig as the query transcript. The user can select one of the transcripts as a reference transcript. Second, the protein-coding sequence (CDS) of the query transcript is predicted by identifying the longest open reading frame (ORF) or FrameDP program (Gouzy et al., 2009). Users can also use the ORF starting AS-EAST Fig. 1. (a) User interface for generating query transcript data. As a reference of exon-skipped transcript sequence generation, the mapping results of RNASeq data from Wang et al. (2008) are shown at the top of the schematic figure in the human dataset. Mapping of the RNA-Seq data was performed using the TopHat program (Trapnell et al., 2009) with default parameters. (b) Interaction residues obtained from 3D structure information assigned to a reference isoform. The deletion-type AS region is shown in red. Interaction residues are denoted with arrowheads in the schematic view and stick models in the 3D structure view. The ligand is shown in a space-filling model. The 3D structure is shown with Jmol (http://www.jmol.org/) with the users' chosen first codon as the CDS. By comparing the genomic regions corresponding to the CDSs of a reference transcript and the query transcript, AS-EAST identifies CDSs changed through AS (termed 'AS CDSs'). The AS CDSs of a reference transcript that have no corresponding region in the query transcript are classified as deletions, and the AS CDSs of the query transcript that have no corresponding region in a reference transcript are classified as insertions.",

The molecular geometry of the Top1 non-covalent binary complex was obtained by modelling the 1A36 PDB entry; after removing the DNA, the same structure was used to obtain a model of the Top1 enzyme in the absence of DNA. The 1T8I PDB entry was used to obtain a model for the ternary complex. The MGLTools 1.5.6 rc1 was used to convert the PDB into PDBQT format, to calculate the GasteigerMarsilii charges and produce the input file. Grid was calculated using an in-house modified version of AutoGrid 4.2.2.1 using a 256\u00d7256\u00d7256 grid with step of 0.5\u00c5 (1\u00c5 = 0.1 nm) enclosing the whole Top1. 250 runs of docking were generated using the standard GA algorithm with AutoDock 4.2.2.1 [27] for Et-KuQ on each of the three systems. The complexes were clusterized on the basis of their RMSD (root-mean-square deviation), using a cut-off value of 2\u00c5.

                    "full_context": "As discussed, the majority of the evidence supporting microRNA annotations now comes from deep-sequencing experiments. We have developed an interface to view reads from RNA deep-sequencing data mapped to microRNA loci on the miRBase web site. Briefly, we identify entries in the Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih .gov/geo/) with short-read data that map to references discovering novel microRNAs. We extract the read sequences and counts from the GEO entry and map the reads to the set of miRBase hairpin sequences for a given organism using Bowtie (6) allowing at most two mismatches between the read and the hairpin sequence. The first deep-sequencing data sets incorporated into miRBase are from human, Drosophila melanogaster, Arabidopsis thaliana, rice and three nematode genomes. Additional data sets will be added rapidly. Ideally, all microRNA sequences submitted to miRBase will be linked to GEO submissions, or followed by the submission of the deep-sequencing data for inclusion in miRBase. The view of deep-sequencing data can be accessed from miRBase stem-loop and mature pages (Figure 2). Reads can be filtered by the number of mismatches to the hairpin sequence, the read count and by experiment. Each experiment is annotated with species, tissue, stage and methodology information. These tags enable the user to search for experiments by tissue expression on the miRBase search page (http://www.mirbase.org/search.shtml). Read counts for mature microRNAs are commonly used as a proxy for relative expression levels. As the number of deepsequencing experiments increases, these data provide extensive information about the expression profiles of microRNAs across tissues, stages and organisms. A good example of the power of these data can be seen in the small RNA data made available through the MODENCODE project for D. melanogaster (7). The patterns of read mappings also provide valuable evidence for relative abundance of mature sequences from different arms, for isoforms of mature microRNA sequences, and for the confidence in a given microRNA annotation. For example, Figure 2 shows a number of isoforms of mature microRNAs derived from both arms of the dme-mir-317 hairpin precursor. The dominant mature sequence from the 3 0 -arm is 21 nt in length, whereas the mature sequence annotated in miRBase 16 is extended to 24 nt. The 5 0 -mature sequence is unannotated in miRBase 16. The miRBase view of read data therefore provides the user with a clear picture of the profile of short RNAs generated from a microRNA locus, and facilitates the correction of errors and omissions in future releases.",

Fresh collections were made from leaves of diverse hosts by placing material in damp chambers for 1-2 d. Single conidial colonies were established from sporulating conidiomata on Petri dishes containing 2 % malt extract agar (MEA) as described earlier by Crous et al. (1991). Colonies were sub-cultured onto potato-dextrose agar (PDA), oatmeal agar (OA), MEA (Crous et al. 2009b), and pine needle agar (PNA) (Lewis 1998), and incubated at 25 \u00b0C under continuous near-ultraviolet light to promote sporulation. Morphological descriptions are based on slide preparations mounted in clear lactic acid from colonies sporulating on PNA. Observations were made with a Zeiss V20 Discovery stereo-microscope, and with a Zeiss Axio Imager 2 light microscope using differential interference contrast (DIC) illumination and an AxioCam MRc5 camera and software. Colony characters and pigment production were noted after 1 mo of growth on MEA, PDA and OA (Crous et al. 2009b) incubated at 25 \u00b0C. Colony colours (surface and reverse) were rated according to the colour charts of Rayner (1970).

Bayesian analyses (critical value for the topological convergence diagnostic set to 0.01) were performed on the individual loci using MrBayes v. 3.2.1 (Huelsenbeck & Ronquist 2001) as described by Crous et al. (2006b). Suitable models were first selected using Models of nucleotide substitution for each gene as determined using MrModeltest (Nylander 2004), and included for each gene partition. The substitution models for each locus are shown in Table 3. Teratosphaeria nubilosa (CPC 12243) was used as outgroup for all phylogenetic analyses.",

ITS sequencing data is easily obtained and a good starting point to rapidly identify genera and sometimes species. If an unknown genus or species is not represented in a curated database such as Q-bank, a GenBank blast could be used to supplement these curated databases. Mycology has a long history of using ITS data to identify fungal species and GenBank would thus be a good supplementary (although not completely curated) database. The use of ITS as the primary locus, and if necessary using a secondary locus following a molecular decision protocol, would be the most stable approach for a reliable identification. This is also the identification protocol as it is currently implemented in Q-bank.",
