            <p>For each participant, a generalized linear model (GLM) was created using time-series predictors for each of the 3 amygdala subregions and 9 nuisance covariates (timeseries predictors for global signal, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, and 6 motion parameters). The global signal is thought to reflect a combination of physiological processes (ie cardiac and respiratory fluctuations), and therefore, it was included in the GLM to control for such factors. Correlation analysis was carried out between the seed ROIs and PFC in a voxel-wise manner using <rs type="software">REST</rs>. The correlation coefficients were then transformed to Z-values using the Fisher r-to-z transformation. In the first-level analysis, a 1-sample t test model was used to delineate the functional connectivity of each amygdala ROI. In the second-level random effects analysis, direct comparisons were conducted to identify differences in functional connectivity between SZ vs HC, BD vs HC, and SZ vs BD. Statistical significance was determined by a corrected P &lt; .05. Correction for multiple comparisons was made by combining individual voxel P &lt; .005 with cluster size &gt; 432mm <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> , determined by the Monte Carlo simulation (<rs type="software">AlphaSim</rs> command line in AFNI [analysis of functional neuroimaging; Cox, 1996] <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">53</ref> ). An additional Bonferroni correction (P = .005/P = .00056) was used as well, because a total of 9 two-sample t tests (SZ vs HC, BD vs HC, and SZ vs BD, multiplied by 3 ROIs) were performed. Exploratory analyses were performed to examine the correlation between the Z-values of regions showing significant group differences and symptom rating scores (the BPRS in the SZ group, and the HDRS and YMRS in the BD group). A 2-tailed P level of .05 was considered significant.</p>
            <p>Data were acquired on a GE Signa HDX 3.0T MRI scanner. A standard head coil was used with foam padding to reduce head motion. Participants were instructed to rest with their eyes closed during scanning. No participant reported falling asleep during the scan when routinely asked immediately after scanning. FMRI data were collected using a gradient-echo planar imaging sequence sensitive to BOLD contrast (TR = 2000ms, TE = 30ms, Diverse Amygdala-Frontal Connectivity in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder flip angle = 90&#176;, FOV = 24 &#215; 24cm, matrix = 64 &#215; 64). Thirty-five axial slices were collected with 3-mm thickness without gap. For spatial normalization and localization, a 3-dimensional fast spoiled gradient-echo T1-weighted sequence was used to acquire high-resolution structural images (TR = 7.1ms, TE = 3.2ms, FOV = 24 &#215; 24cm, matrix = 240 &#215; 240, slice thickness = 1.0mm without gap, 176 slices, 1 averages). Image preprocessing was carried out using <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC3932086-software-100">SPM5</rs> (<rs type="url" corresp="#PMC3932086-software-100">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm</rs>) and <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC3932086-software-111">Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit (REST)</rs> (<rs type="url" corresp="#PMC3932086-software-111">http:// www.restfmri.net</rs>). Preprocessing using <rs type="software">SPM5</rs> consisted of slice-time correction, motion correction, spatial normalization, and spatial smoothing full width at half maximum (FWHM = 6mm). Movement parameters were examined for each participant. Data sets with more than 2mm maximum translation in x, y or z, or 2&#176; of maximum rotation about 3 axes between each image were excluded. Preprocessing using <rs type="software">REST</rs> consisted of removing linear drift through linear regression and temporal band-pass filtering (0.01-0.08 Hz) to reduce the effects of lowfrequency drifts and physiological high-frequency noise.</p>
            <p>In direct comparison between the SZ and BD groups, the SZ group showed significantly decreased rsFC between the LB amygdala and right DLPFC (BA 46/9) compared with the BD group (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>). In contrast, the BD group showed significantly decreased rsFC between the LB amygdala and pregenual ACC (BA 24) and rostral PFC (BA 10) compared with the SZ group (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>; figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>). These findings correspond to a corrected P &lt; .05 by <rs type="software">AlphaSim</rs> correction.</p>
            <p>In direct comparison between the SZ and BD groups, the SZ group showed significantly decreased rsFC between the CM amygdala and right DLPFC (BA 46/9) compared with the BD group (table 2; figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>). These findings correspond to a corrected P &lt; .05 by <rs type="software">AlphaSim</rs> correction.</p>
            <p>In direct comparison between the SZ and BD groups, the SZ group showed significantly decreased FC between the SF amygdala and right DLPFC (BA 46/9) and left DLPFC (BA 46/9) compared with the BD group (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>). In contrast, the BD group showed significantly decreased rsFC between the SF amygdala and pregenual/ ventral ACC, rostral PFC (BA 24/25/32/10), and right OFC (BA 47), and left OFC (BA 47) with extension into the temporopolar area (BA 38) compared with the SZ group (table 2; figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>). These findings correspond to a corrected P &lt; .05 by <rs type="software">AlphaSim</rs> correction. Findings also survived Bonferroni correction for multiple t tests (P = .00056) except for those in the right ventral ACC-CM amygdala rsFC and left ventral ACC-SF amygdala rsFC in HC vs BD, right DLPFC-SF amygdala rsFC in HC vs SZ, and left pregenual ACC and rostral PFC-LB amygdala rsFC in SZ vs BD (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p>

            <p>We focused on the differential expression of genes involved in cellular biofunctions with a criterion of FC &gt;1.2 using the IPA software. While several genes overlapped based on cellular functions, we were able to cluster them according to their GO annotations as: cell cycle, cell death, cell morphology, growth and proliferation, development, and movement (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). The individual heatmaps were generated according to hierarchal clustering of genes which are involved in the cellular processes (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). According to IPA analysis, there were 66 differentially expressed genes detected to have a role in cellular movement ; 48 were upregulated, and 18 were FIGURE 1 | Venn diagrams. Multiple microarray experiments were designed to detect differential expression of transcripts with TGF&#946; treatment and were compared using Venn diagrams. List of differentially expressed genes with their accession IDs were uploaded to <rs type="software">GeneVenn</rs>, query was run, and the detected numbers and gene lists were exported to MS Excel. Graphical figure is illustrated using the <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC3322527-software-100">Adobe Photoshop</rs> (<rs type="publisher" corresp="#PMC3322527-software-100">Adobe Inc,</rs> CA, USA). Relations among the list of altered genes within TGF&#946; treatment groups are depicted as intersections or uniqueness. A significant overlap of differentially expressed genes was observed between the TGF&#946;1 and TGF&#946;2 treatment groups both in the upregulated (A) or downregulated (B) gene lists.</p>
            <p>A table of genes vital to the morphogenesis of orofacial development was constructed based on the most recent literature review (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">A2</ref> in Appendix; <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Wilkie and Morriss-Kay, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Lidral and Moreno, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gritli-Linde, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dixon et al., 2011)</ref>. Genes from the table of cellular biofunctions (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) were merged with the Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">A2</ref> in Appendix to filter the differentially expressed genes according to putative candidates for palatal deformities. Some of the genes listed were identified as being important for palatogenesis in mouse, but not directly associated with human cases of cleft palate and thus remain "putative" cleft palate genes in the latter, as labeled with asterisk ( * ) in the Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">A2</ref> in Appendix. Overlapping genes (n = 11) were presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> with their FC and p-values. Among these genes, EDN1, INHBA, TGF&#946;1, TGF&#946;2, RUNX1, LHX8, SNAI1, PDGFC, and PIGA were upregulated; while only SMAD3 was downregulated in response to TGF&#946;treatment. Intriguingly, TGF&#946;R1 was upregulated with TGF&#946;1 treatment and downregulated with TGF&#946;2 treatment; which correlates with FIGURE 3 | Direct and indirect relations of most differentially expressed genes with TGF&#946;. Affymetrix probe identifiers and FC values of significantly altered transcripts (n = 27) were uploaded to <rs type="software">IPA</rs> and each identifier was mapped to its corresponding gene object in the IKB. Interactions were then queried between these gene objects and all other gene objects stored within <rs type="software">IPA</rs> to generate a set of direct interaction networks that were merged. Networks with the highest number of molecules were selected, overlaid with TGF&#946; molecules, and organized using Path Designer of <rs type="software">IPA</rs>. Upregulated transcripts were highlighted with orange (A); and downregulated transcripts were highlighted with green (B). Types of molecules were annotated in the legend in the box. isoform-specific receptor requirement in TGF&#946; signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Rojas et al., 2009)</ref>. <rs type="software">Ingenuity pathway analysis</rs>, a knowledge based program to generate relevant and interacting biological networks, was used to determine how the differentially expressed overlapping genes might interact to facilitate cellular biofunctions. A direct interaction network of the orofacial deformity susceptibility genes, overlaid with clustered cellular biofunctions crucial for development and maturation of the palatal mesenchyme was generated and is presented in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Finally, the localization of differentially expressed genes within the canonical TGF&#946; pathway was illustrated by using the <rs type="software">IPA</rs> Path Designer in FIGURE 4 | Hierarchical clustering (heatmap) analysis of differentially expressed transcripts. Altered genes were clustered based on cellular biofunctions and heatmaps were constructed using <rs type="software">Bioconductor</rs>. Coexpressed groups of genes were illustrated with dendrograms and progressively and distinctly up-or downregulated genes were ranked accordingly. Each column corresponds to the expression profile of a treatment (either TGF&#946; or Control) in triplicate, and each row corresponds to a transcript. The increasing intensities of red signify a higher expression in the given sample of a specific mRNA, whereas the increasing intensities of green indicate a lower expression of mRNA and black indicates mean level expression. The list of genes for each particular function (A-F) was shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.  </p>

            <p>COS-1 cells were grown on glass cover-slips and transfected as indicated earlier. At 48 hours after transfection, cells were fixed with ice-cold 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated with the primary antibody anti-Flag M2 (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) and the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 488 Donkey Anti-Goat IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC; Invitrogen). Finally, cells were stained with 4&#8242;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich Co.), and cover-slips were mounted onto microscope slides in the presence of Mowiol mounting medium. Fluorescence images were captured with a LEICA TCS SP5 DMI-6000B confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems Inc., Wetzlar, Germany) using excitation wavelength of 488 nm (for FITC) and were analyzed with LEICA <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC5449105-software-100">LAS AF</rs> (<rs type="publisher" corresp="#PMC5449105-software-100">Leica Microsystems Inc.</rs>).

            <p>The platform literature captures the strategies of all of the rivals except Google and, too some degree, Apple. Apple, by not allowing complementors in manufacturing (it controls all manufacturing through outsourcing), strictly controlling application developers, and exclusively licensing operators, differs from the more open platform strategies discussed in most of the literature. Google has introduced a platform, but, at the moment, has undertaken none of the strategic initiatives one would expect if it was intending to monetize the platform. As mentioned earlier, for example, it has allowed operators to fork <rs type="software">Android</rs>. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> It gives little support to and exerts little control over the applications community, allowing malware applications to emerge. While this strategy might change in the future if <rs type="software">Android</rs> becomes dominant, this suggests that it is not pursuing a textbook platform strategy. It is impossible to generalize from a single case that is still evolving, but it indicates the possibility of using platforms, as auxiliaries to different value-capture strategies than has been understood in the platform literature.</p>
            <p>Apple has enormous advantages in the sense that it was the first mover and has continually been the aggressor moving from the iPod to the iPhone and now the iPad using an almost seamless user experience. These strengths and the momentum are powerful. Though the iOS devices allow users to access the entire Internet, the hardware exists in a closed platform of <rs type="software">iTunes</rs> and the <rs type="software">App Store</rs>. The popularity and elegance of Apple's product offer ample opportunity to application providers, but Apple's supreme power in the ecosystem places them in a vulnerable position. Unfortunately, this closed platform strategy is assailable and is now threatened by Google. Banishing Adobe, a very important complementor, from the iPhone world drove a neutral party with enormous software capabilities toward the <rs type="software">Android</rs> world. Whether or not it is true that <rs type="software">Flash</rs> would have allowed software vendors to sell directly to iPhone users and not be forced to go through the Apple App's store <ref type="bibr">(Copeland 2010)</ref>, it created an instant and unforeseen ally for <rs type="software">Android</rs>.</p>
            <p>In the U.S., Nokia had little market share, so when Google offered <rs type="software">Android</rs>, the carriers and the phone makers felt a strong economic pressure to adopt as they needed a response to the iPhone. <rs type="software">Windows Mobile</rs> was inferior to <rs type="software">Android</rs> and appeared more costly. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> In many respects, for other members of the mobile telephony ecosystem, <rs type="software">Android</rs> was the only viable choice-despite the fact that they feared it would commoditize their network. The alternative was to lose market share and lucrative data download revenues. Moreover, since Google generates revenues through advertisements, it can share these ad revenues with carriers, thereby giving them a stake in encouraging more <rs type="software">Android</rs> phones to use their network. Google's acquisition of AdMob helped make this possible (Frommer 2010). Recently, Apple has offered other carriers their own iPhones, a necessary response, as the other carriers were becoming all <rs type="software">Android</rs> operations.</p>
            <p><rs type="software">Android</rs> provides an increasingly attractive platform upon which applications can be built, thereby competing for developer attention with Apple. As is true on the Internet, Google's main revenue source on the mobile Internet will be advertising revenue. Depending upon how it handles access to the Android platform, it can afford not to extract rents from the application developers-a model that contrasts with Apple's onerous terms <ref type="bibr">(Apple 2010)</ref>. The <rs type="software">Android</rs> business model also provides a platform that is not directly controlled by Google, thereby separating it from direct responsibility for the types of applications developed, but also suggesting that Google is unlikely to directly compete with third-party applications.</p>
            <p>The <rs type="software">Android</rs> challenge is asymmetric because Google is agnostic in almost all directions. In the first instance, it is purely interested in growth of traffic that it can monetize through advertising. The free operating system unfetters pure-play manufacturers from worrying about either building their own OS or licensing the OS from a direct competitor. Google can provide an elegant low-cost OS because Google's monetization strategy relocates value capture. The <rs type="software">Android</rs> platform encourages new entrants of all sorts, and the seriousness of the challenge to both Nokia and Apple is clear. At an employee event, Apple CEO Steve Jobs is reported to have exclaimed, "We did not enter the search business. They entered the phone business. Make no mistake-they want to kill the iPhone" <ref type="bibr">(Abell 2010)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Nokia's strength as the dominant cell phone incumbent should not be underestimated. Only 2 years ago, the Nokia/<rs type="software">Symbian</rs> global smartphone market share was enormous, but as Table <ref type="table">3</ref> indicates it is rapidly losing market share. While it has critical complementary assets, including close relationships with many of the world's largest carriers, first-class manufacturing, deep technological capabilities, and rapidly increasing cell phone market share in the world's developing country markets, the threat to its domination are clear.</p>
            <p>The apparent inability of Microsoft to transition its PC dominance to the mobile Internet, may, at least in part, be attributed to its initial inability to secure a dominant position in the Internet world. While Cusumano and Yoffie (1998) analyzed Microsoft's defeat of <rs type="software">Netscape</rs> in web browsers, what they could not foresee was that Microsoft would be unable to use <rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs> to extract greater value from the Internet. The browser became a free good and it would be Google that would use its search engine to become the dominant firm on the Internet-it was agnostic toward other browsers but favored Mozilla, an open-source alliance. Interestingly, with the release of the <rs type="software">Chrome</rs> browser, Google appears to have turned on Mozilla.</p>
            <p>The United States, with its large smartphone market, has an industry architecture that is important to consider. For example, the network carriers in the U.S. play a prominent role in everything from customer engagement to handset development. In Jacobides' language, there are designed factors (e.g., multiple incompatible network standards, primarily GSM and CDMA) and emergent factors (culture of subscription-based usage plans), both of which increase switching costs and lock-in customers, that contribute to this. Carriers such as Verizon and AT&amp;T not only operate the network, but also sell handsets and provide content, in essence vying to be a one-stop shop for end-users in their mobile experience. The degree to which handset manufacturers must work with the carriers is reflected in the pricing for smartphones in the U.S.-typically $200 or less if the customer signs up for a 1-or 2-year contract, a fraction of the full retail price. This subsidization of the purchase price, which the carrier earns back through monthly subscription revenue, creates a very high barrier to entry for independent retailers or handset manufacturers wanting to sell standalone smartphones direct to customers. 1 Carriers in the U.S. typically set their product requirements and OEM product development is carried out accordingly. Apple was the exception, as U.S. carriers (AT&amp;T and now Verizon) accepted the Apple product as designed. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> In addition to the expected and necessary collaboration-for example, between carriers and chip designers to optimize network performance-carriers are making decisions about how data is consumed on their networks (e.g., charging for data plans) and what services can be used (e.g., <rs type="software">Skype</rs> or other VoIP clients). Further, as part of their effort to lock-in customers, carriers seek to provide unique services, such as proprietary content or applications that distinguish the phones that they sell. A key question is whether firms that focus on the lucrative U.S. market, and who must therefore operate within the roles and influences of the industry architecture there, must adapt their strategies in other markets where the architecture is different.</p>
            <p>More specifically, Google's business model may offer two general lock-in strategies that extend to the mobile space. First, rather than seeing Google's wide variety of offerings as intrinsically synergistic, they can rather be seen being a set of diverse hooks that anchor users to Google-none of which, except possibly search and Gmail, are particularly sticky. For each and every service it offers there are competitors and switching costs are not very high. The lack of stickiness drives Google to constantly experiment with and introduce other hooks for users. Second, what binds the entire Google empire together is its enormous stores of searchable databases, its ability to incredibly quickly serve this data and to match the appropriate advertisement to the content being requested. A key question for Google is whether it will be able to transfer its myriad services, each with their small hooks, into relevant mobile services that users want and that Google can monetize. The promise of mobile advertising is great, and Google's success with mapping and local business directory position it well for innovating around this new potential revenue stream. While lacking powerful stickiness, Apple's initially close relationship with Google was an important reason for the quick success of the iPhone, as one of the first and most important applications for the iPhone was to use Google Search <ref type="bibr">(West and Mace 2010)</ref>.</p>

            <p>The mitochondrial assembly method was largely similar to that of the chloroplast; however, a reasonably close reference mitochondrial genome was not available for the initial read-mapping. <rs type="software">Geneious de novo assembly</rs> was performed with default settings on the entire data set, divided into three approximately equal parts to reduce RAM requirements to feasible levels. Mitochondrial contigs were distinguished by <rs type="software">BLAST</rs> searches against the Vitis vinifera L. mitochondrial genome <ref type="bibr">( Goremykin et al., 2008 )</ref>. This procedure was found to produce very long mitochondrial contigs compared to preliminary Velvet and SOAP <ref type="bibr">( Luo et al., 2012 )</ref> assemblies, as long as 122,611 bp. Comparing the assemblies revealed that the <rs type="software">Geneious</rs> contigs contained all of the mitochondrial sequence assembled by the other programs, but in fewer pieces. Consensus sequences of these contigs ( n = 39) were used in iterative assembly, circular reference construction, and assembly validation as above.</p>

            <p>Enrichment statistics -Percent on-target statistics ( Table <ref type="table">1</ref> ) were calculated by mapping reads to the reference loci using the <rs type="software">Geneious native assembler</rs> (low sensitivity settings) and dividing the number of mapped reads by the total number of reads per each accession; the same method was used to determine read percentages for the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes using the mitochondrial and chloroplast references. Other assembly statistics ( Table <ref type="table">1</ref> ) were derived from the BWA assemblies used in downstream analyses, but also calculated in <rs type="software">Geneious</rs>. Missing data, pairwise identity, and other alignment statistics ( Table <ref type="table">2</ref> ) were derived in <rs type="software">Geneious</rs> from the <rs type="software">MAFFT</rs> alignments.</p>

            <p>Low copy marker sequence assembly -Assembly of data for each species reused as a reference the initial 278 contigs of H. parvifl ora var. saurensis that were used for probe design. We reasoned that contigs that were suffi cient for designing effi cient enrichment probes should also be able to inform sequence assembly, avoiding the need for computationally demanding and often unsatisfactory de novo methods. We mapped reads to the 278 references using the relatively indel-tolerant BWA program (v. 0.7.12; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Li and Durbin, 2009 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Li, 2013 )</ref>, with the default settings for paired-end data; fi nally, the resultant contigs were imported into <rs type="software">Geneious</rs>. Consensus sequences were extracted from these contigs in <rs type="software">Geneious</rs> using default settings, including trimming the consensus to the length of the reference sequence. Each locus was aligned individually using MAFFT 7.017 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">( Katoh et al., 2009 )</ref> with default settings. One of the loci (labeled Locus 4 in the probe panel, wherein loci are numbered in order of descending length; data available from the Dryad Digital Repository: http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4cn66 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[ Folk et al., 2015 ]</ref>) was found to yield only partial sequences from many taxa, resulting in large amounts of missing data (see Results); this has been excluded from the analyses, leaving 277 effectively enriched loci.</p>
            <p>Off-target sequence assembly -We repeated the reference-mapping in BWA with mitochondrial and chloroplastic references to attempt to construct chloroplast genomes and mitochondrial genomes from off-target reads. For the chloroplast assembly, we used fully assembled plastomes from H. parvifl ora var. saurensis , H. parishii Rydb. (below), and H. sanguinea (M. Moore, unpublished data). The closest of these three references to each sample based on a preliminary Sanger chloroplast phylogeny (unpublished data) was used for reference-mapping to assist in assembling long, divergent intergenic regions. Development of a third plastome reference was necessary for the divergent intergenic regions of H. parishii , H. elegans Abrams, and H. abramsii Rydb.; this was constructed by mapping the H. parishii reads to the H. parvifl ora var. saurensis plastome in BWA and repeating the assembly refi nement methods used for the H. parvifl ora plastome assembly. Mitochondrial assembly used the fully assembled reference from H. parvifl ora var. saurensis . Because we desired purely mitochondrial signal for the mitochondrial phylogenetic analysis, this genome was blasted against the H. parvifl ora chloroplast genome and any hits were deleted from the mitochondrial assembly reference. Whole chloroplast genomes were aligned in MAFFT as with the single-copy markers; however, this was computationally infeasible for the much longer mitochondrial sequences. For these we used Mauve, setting an assumption of collinear genomes (which was enforced for our contigs by the read-mapping method) but otherwise using default settings.</p>
            <p>Enrichment statistics -Percent on-target statistics ( Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> ) were calculated by mapping reads to the reference loci using the <rs type="software">Geneious native assembler</rs> (low sensitivity settings) and dividing the number of mapped reads by the total number of reads per each accession; the same method was used to determine read percentages for the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes using the mitochondrial and chloroplast references. Other assembly statistics ( Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> ) were derived from the BWA assemblies used in downstream analyses, but also calculated in <rs type="software">Geneious</rs>. Missing data, pairwise identity, and other alignment statistics ( Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> ) were derived in <rs type="software">Geneious</rs> from the <rs type="software">MAFFT</rs> alignments.</p>
            <p>The 277 gene alignments were also analyzed individually in <rs type="software">RAxML</rs> to infer gene trees, with the GTR-GAMMA model and 1000 bootstrap replicates.

            <p>Probe-based target enrichment -Verifi ed libraries were used in a MYcroarray MyBaits in-solution hybridization protocol using our custom phylogenetic locus panel, following manufacturer protocols (version 2) with the following modifi cations: eight libraries were pooled per MyBaits reaction (60 ng each for 480 ng total input DNA in 6 &#956; L) to reduce reagent cost and required input DNA, and hybridization was conducted for 36 h. PCR conditions used an annealing temperature of 60 &#176; C, an elongation time of 45 s, 15 total cycles, and 10 &#956; L of template. Target-enriched library pools were verified for size distribution on an Agilent Bioanalyzer, and quantified with an Illumina library quantification kit (KAPA, Wilmington, Massachusetts, USA). Because adapter dimers were problematic for one of the pools, all pools were cleaned following the paramagnetic bead-based cleaning procedure in the NEBNext protocol but with 0.8 volumes of AMPure beads to 1 volume of enriched library. For all target arbitrarily excluded the last 49.3% of the intron matrix (introns of approximately loci 88-277) to yield a matrix of equivalent length to the exon matrix.

            <p>Following the initial TE detection phase we examined each position where a TE was identified, including TEs identified in the appropriate reference, in each other line in that species. At this stage, we were able to both identify TEs which had previously been missed by our pipeline as well as to make absence calls by reconstructing a contig that spans the TE insertion location. Repetitive content independent of TEs was defined using an all-by-all <rs type="software">BLASTn</rs> comparison <ref type="bibr">(Altschul et al. 1990</ref>) of sequence 500-bp upstream and downstream of duplication coordinates in the D. yakuba and D. simulans references at an E value 10 &#192;5 with no filter for low complexity or repetitive sequences. We used a resampling approach to identify overrepresentation of duplications associated with direct repeats. We performed 10,000,000 replicates choosing the same number of tandem duplications at random and determining whether an equal or greater number was identified on the X chromosome.</p>
            <p>Tandem Duplications in Nonmodel Drosophila . doi:10.1093/molbev/msu124 MBE Supplementary Material online). To account for duplications which may be undetected, we additionally included variants that showed 2-fold increases (fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>) in quantile normalized coverage (supplementary figs. S2 and S3, Supplementary Material online) and which are supported by one or more divergently oriented read pairs were also identified as having duplications if the duplicate was present in a second strain, thereby correcting sample frequency estimates for false negatives (see Materials and Methods, supplementary text S1, Supplementary Material online). We retained only those tandem duplicates which are not present in outgroup reference genomes of D. melanogaster, D. erecta, and D. yakuba or D. simulans as defined in a <rs type="software">BLAST</rs> search (see Materials and Methods) suggesting recent origins.</p>
            <p>Repetitive sequences are known to facilitate ectopic recombination events that commonly yield tandem duplications <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Lim and Simmons 1994)</ref>. In D. yakuba, 179 (12.7%) tandem duplications fall within 1 kb of a transposable element (TE) in at least one sample strain that has a duplication and 52 (3.7%) fall within 100 bp of a TE (supplementary table <ref type="table">S25</ref>, Supplementary Material online). In D. simulans, 122 (12.5%) lie within 1 kb of a TE and 53 (5.4%) fall within 100 bp of a TE (supplementary table <ref type="table">S25</ref>, Supplementary Material online). Additionally, 125 (8.8%) of duplications in D. yakuba have 100 bp or more of direct repeated sequence in the 500 bp up and downstream of duplication boundaries and 237 (16.7%) have 30 bp or more in the reference sequence as identified in a <rs type="software">BLASTn</rs> comparison of regions flanking divergently oriented read spans at an E value 10 &#192;5 (supplementary table <ref type="table">S25</ref>, Supplementary Material online). In D. simulans, 56 (5.7%) have 100 bp or more of direct repeated sequence in the 500 bp up and downstream of duplication boundaries in the reference and 150 (14.4%) have 30 bp or more of repeated sequence (supplementary table <ref type="table">S25</ref>, Supplementary Material online). In total 371 duplications in D. yakuba and 243 duplications in D. simulans either lie within 1 kb of a TE in at least one strain or are flanked by 30 bp or more of direct repeated sequence. Hence, a maximum of 26.2% of duplications identified in D. yakuba and 24.9% of duplications identified in D. simulans may have been facilitated by ectopic recombination between large repeats, consistent with previous estimates from single genome studies of 30% in D. melanogaster but somewhat higher than those in D. yakuba of 12% <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Zhou et al. 2008)</ref>.</p>
            <p>In D. yakuba, 14.4% of duplications with 100 bp or more of repetitive sequence and 21.1% of duplications with 30 bp or more are located on the X. In contrast, 46.4% of duplications FIG. <ref type="figure">9</ref>. Dual promoter genes. Duplicated sequence is highlighted with bold colors and is framed by the dashed box. Tandem duplication where both boundaries fall within coding sequences results in a chimeric gene which contains two promoters, one which facilitates transcription in one direction, the other facilitating transcription from the opposite strand. The chimera is capable of making partial antisense transcripts. <ref type="bibr">Rogers et al. . doi:10</ref>.1093/molbev/msu124 MBE in D. simulans with 100 bp or more of direct repeated sequence in the reference and 44.7% with more than 30 bp of repeated sequence in the D. simulans reference lie on the X chromosome. Based on a resampling of randomly chosen duplications, duplications on the X chromosome are overrepresented among duplications with direct repeats (P &lt; 10 &#192;7 ) but the same is not true of duplicates with direct repeats in D. yakuba (P &#188; 0:248). A genome wide <rs type="software">BLASTn</rs> comparison shows that direct repeats are not overrepresented on the D. simulans X chromosome and cannot explain the observed association (supplementary table <ref type="table">S26</ref>, Supplementary Material online). Hence, duplication via ectopic recombination may be exceptionally common on the X chromosome in D. simulans.</p>
            <p>All tandem duplications identified are polymorphic in populations and are therefore expected to be extremely young. However, tandem duplications may be identified in sample strains relative to the references if they are new mutations in the sample or if they represent ancestral sequence that has returned to single copy in the reference through deletion. In order to identify duplications that represent the ancestral state, we pulled reference sequence corresponding to the maximum duplicate span and ran a <rs type="software">BLASTn</rs> comparison of the sequence against the D. melanogaster, D. erecta, and D. yakuba or D. simulans reference genomes at an E value cutoff of 10 &#192;5 .</p>
            <p>Once TEs were annotated in the reference genomes, TEs were detected in the 20 sample genomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Mackay et al. 2012)</ref> which include both TE presence and TE absence calls. Briefly, initial TE detection was done by identifying all read pairs where one member of the pair aligned uniquely to the reference and the other member aligned to any known TE sequence were identified. Unique reads were clustered if they aligned to the same strand of the same chromosome, within a Tandem Duplications in Nonmodel Drosophila . doi:10.1093/molbev/msu124 MBE given threshold distance. This threshold was defined as the 99th quantile of mapping distances observed for uniquely mapping read pairs that are properly paired and lie in the expected orientation on opposite strands. At least three read pairs from each of the left and right estimates, in the correct orientation and correct strand, were required to indicate a TE. Phrap (version 1.090518) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ewing and Green 1998)</ref> with the following parameters (&#192;forcelevel 10 &#192;minscore 10 &#192;minmatch 10) was used to reassemble the local area around the TE insertion breakpoint. Contigs were classified according to TE family based on alignments in a <rs type="software">BLASTn</rs> search <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Altschul et al. 1990)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Following the initial TE detection phase we examined each position where a TE was identified, including TEs identified in the appropriate reference, in each other line in that species. At this stage, we were able to both identify TEs which had previously been missed by our pipeline as well as to make absence calls by reconstructing a contig that spans the TE insertion location.

We used a resampling approach to identify overrepresentation of duplications associated with direct repeats. We performed 10,000,000 replicates choosing the same number of tandem duplications at random and determining whether an equal or greater number was identified on the X chromosome.</p>
            <p>Tandem repeats which might putatively facilitate ectopic recombination may hinder identification of tandem duplicates if repeat sequences are identical. We performed an all-by-all <rs type="software">BLASTn</rs> of all chromosomes for each of the reference genomes at an E value of 10 &#192;5 with low complexity filters turned off (&#192;F F). Ignoring identical self hits, we identified all directly repeated sequences with &gt;99.5% nucleotide identity which are &gt;300 bp in length and which lie within 25 kb of one another, in accordance with the criteria for identifying duplicates.</p>

            <p>The coding sequence of the mouse INHBB gene (accession number: NM_008381) was derived from the NCBI GenBank database. Three target sites were selected according to an RNAi program <ref type="bibr">[31]</ref>, and their specificity was further confirmed through a <rs type="software">BLAST</rs> search. The typical structure of short hairpin RNA has been previously described <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref>. The two complementary oligonucleotides of this short hairpin structure were annealed and inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the RNAi-Ready pSIREN-RetroQZsGreen Vector (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). These plasmids were named pshRNA-B1, pshRNA-B2 and pshRNA-B3, respectively (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). On the other hand, a plasmid with a non-specific sequence was used as a negative control (pshRNA-negative) and was described elsewhere <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref>. These recombinant plasmids vectors independently express a Zoanthus sp. green fluorescent protein, engineered for brighter fluorescence (excitation maximum = 496 nm; emission maximum = 506 nm), and as result, transfected cells emit green fluorescent protein (GFP).</p>
            <p>Cells were collected 48 h after transfection and washed in cold PBS, and lysed in RIPA buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After 1 h incubation at 4 C, cells were centrifuged at 12000 g for 10 min for the removal of cellular debris. Total protein concentration was measured by a BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, USA), and 20 &#181;g of total protein was subjected to gel electrophoresis. Proteins were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel before transferring them to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). After blocking in PBS supplemented with 5% skim milk (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich), membranes were incubated overnight at 4 C with primary antibodies including anti-inhibin &#946;B (1:200, Proteintech Group); anti-Bax (1:800, Bioworld Technology), anti-cyclin D1 (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-cyclin E (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-Bcl-2 (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After incubation with the primary antibodies, membranes were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, incubated for 2 h with 5000-fold diluted HRP-labeled goat antirabbit secondary antibodies (Wuhan Boster Biological Engineering) at room temperature and washed three times with prewarmed PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. After washing, blots were developed using an ECL Western blotting detection system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and then exposed to X-ray film for visualization of the protein bands. PVDF blots were then stripped of bound antibodies and treated with rabbit anti-GAPDH antibody (1:1000, Hangzhou Goodhere Biotechnology, Hangzhou, PR China) for normalization. The band intensities were measured with the <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC4623144-software-100">AlphaEaseFC</rs> software (<rs type="publisher" corresp="#PMC4623144-software-100">Alpha Innotech</rs>, San Leandro, CA, USA).</p>

            <p>In addition to greater coverage, modules identified using function-based alignment displayed higher biological coherence than sequence-based alignment using any of the other methods (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>). Almost 50% of the modules identified by our technique scored 0.5 or more compared to only 30% when using sequence-based <rs type="software">MAS</rs>; <rs type="software">MaWISH</rs> and <rs type="software">NetworkBLAST</rs> both performed far worse. As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>b, function-based alignment also identifies modules that correlate better with experimentally verified complexes. Around one-third of the modules correspond well(overlap &gt;50%) with a MIPS complex as opposed to only one-tenth of the modules from <rs type="software">MaWISH</rs> and <rs type="software">NetworkBlast</rs>.</p>
            <p>We compared the performance of function and sequence-based network alignment by aligning the human network with yeast and fly networks.Function-based alignment was carried out using <rs type="software">MAS</rs> only, while sequencebased alignment was done using <rs type="software">MAS</rs>, <rs type="software">MaWISH</rs> and <rs type="software">NetworkBlast</rs>. For sequence-based alignment, the orthology file was generated by selecting pairs of proteins with <rs type="software">BLAST</rs> E-values &#8804;1e&#8722;7 the cut-off used by <ref type="bibr">Sharan et al. (2005)</ref>. The combined method was tested by using alignment results from <rs type="software">MAS</rs> (both sequence and function based) as input. To observe the effect of multiple networks combined method was executed using sets of two (human-yeast, human-fly, fly-yeast and human-worm) as well as three (human-yeast-fly) networks.</p>
            <p>We tested our new similarity measure using the <rs type="software">MAS</rs> network alignment algorithm. Instead of creating an alignment graph, <rs type="software">MAS</rs> uses a recursive process that alternately identifies locally matching nodes across two networks and then splits the matching sub-graphs into connected components. Nodes are deemed locally matching if they share sequence similarity as well as network neighborhood. In the case of multiple orthologs for a node, the orthologs are aligned independently of each other. They can therefore be part of different sub-graphs in the alignment. <rs type="software">MAS</rs> is relatively fast and uses a flexible node similarity component that uses <rs type="software">BLAST</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Altschul et al., 1990)</ref> E-values in the original implementation. We modified it to use our functional similarity scores. A cutoff score of 0.9 was used to select highly similar proteins. We found that this particular choice of cutoff identifies functional matches for a significant proportion of proteins across two species whilst keeping multiple hits within reasonable limits.</p>
            <p>The human DAB <ref type="bibr">(Moldanodo et al., 1990</ref>) is a multi-protein complex involved in transcription initiation and consists of the TFIID complex, TFIIA complex and TFIIB. It is present in the MIPS database as complex ID 493 which lists 16 proteins as its subunits, 15 of which are transcription initiation factors and 1 is a TATA-box binding protein. It is a typical target of module detection methods both in terms of the number of proteins involved as well as the tight functional relationships between them. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the performance of our combined approach along with <rs type="software">NetworkBlast</rs> and <rs type="software">MaWish</rs> in terms of their ability to correctly identify this complex in the human network.</p>
            <p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> also shows the execution time for each of the methods on a machine with a 1.66 GHz processor with 1 GB RAM. Further analysis of other species (Supplementary Material) indicates that the run times of the alignment algorithms are extremely sensitive to the number of orthologs between two species. The simultaneous clustering approach is an exception to this, as it does not experience an explosion in the number of possible alignments due to multiple possible orthologs, experienced by <rs type="software">MAS</rs>, <rs type="software">NetworkBlast</rs> and <rs type="software">MaWISH</rs>.</p>
            <p>The availability of large-scale protein interaction datasets has made it possible to carry out high level graph theoretic analysis of the interactomes of several species [see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bork et al. (2004)</ref> for a review]. Many studies have searched for higher level organization and modularity within the network by breaking it up into relatively independent modules, which may correspond to biologically relevant complexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Han et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kashtan and Alon, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Spirin et al., 2003)</ref>. Several algorithms have been designed in recent years which use interaction information alone to identify functional modules and complexes. Most of these algorithms identify dense regions of high connectivity with relatively low connectivity to the rest of network <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bader and Hogue, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Krogan et al., 2006)</ref>. These dense sub-graphs are treated as potential functional modules. For instance, <rs type="software">MCODE</rs> <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bader and Hogue, 2003)</ref> first identifies putative complexes using local network * To whom correspondence should be addressed. density and then filters away those which do not contain subgraphs with minimal degree two. Another graph-based method, MCL <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dongen et al., 2000)</ref>, simulates a large number of quenched random walks of varying length from each node of the graph using an expansion step and combines this with an inflation step to partition the graph into subsets that do not have paths between them.</p>

            <p>Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) constitute a particular family of tandem repeats found in a wide range of prokaryotic genomes (half of eubacteria and almost all archaea). They consist of a succession of highly conserved regions (DR) varying in size from 23 to 47 bp, separated by similarly sized unique sequences (spacer) of usually viral origin. A CRISPR cluster is flanked on one side by an AT-rich sequence called the leader and assumed to be a transcriptional promoter. Recent studies suggest that this structure represents a putative RNA-interference-based immune system. Here we describe <rs type="software">CRISPRFinder</rs>, a web service offering tools to (i) detect CRISPRs including the shortest ones (one or two motifs); (ii) define DRs and extract spacers; (iii) get the flanking sequences to determine the leader; (iv) blast spacers against Genbank database and (v) check if the DR is found elsewhere in prokaryotic sequenced genomes. <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC1933234-software-100">CRISPRFinder</rs> is freely accessible at <rs type="url" corresp="#PMC1933234-software-100">http://crispr.u-psud.fr/Server/ CRISPRfinder.php</rs>.</p>
            <p>To check that <rs type="software">CRISPRFinder</rs> was efficient in recovering all the CRISPRs from a genome, we compared the results to other available studies on CRISPRs <ref type="bibr">(15,20)</ref>. The data were generally in good agreement, the differences being always in the DR boundaries' identification (more accurate with <rs type="software">CRISPRFinder</rs>) or in the number of motifs found, as the truncated DR is sometimes neglected or short clusters are not detected with other programs. Interestingly, some strains were claimed to be devoid of CRISPRs by Godde and colleagues but proved to have short CRISPRs with <rs type="software">CRISPRFinder</rs>, such as in different Shigella sp. (S. sonnei Ss046, S. flexneri 2a str. 301, S. flexneri 2a str), or even long CRISPRs such as in Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14. The latter example is shown on the <rs type="software">CRISPRfinder</rs> website (sample2), and as can be seen by using the BLAST spacer function, six spacers out of thirty six at two different CRISPR loci, correspond to a bacteriophage sequence (bacteriophages F116, B3, D3112, DMS3 and phi CTX).</p>
            <p>In addition, there is no user-friendly dedicated web site. A specialized program to automatically identify CRISPRs seems to be mandatory for their optimum, rapid exploration and in-depth analysis, in order to increase the efficiency of CRISPRs investigations. <rs type="software">CRISPRFinder</rs> is a web service offering fundamental tools for CRISPR detection, including the shortest ones, allowing an accurate definition of the DR consensus boundaries and extraction of the related spacers. It offers also additional tools to analyze the CRISPR loci: (i) obtain the CRISPR and the flanking sequences according to flexible size; (ii) make a blast of selected spacers or flanking sequences against the Genbank database and (iii) check if the DR is found elsewhere in prokaryotic sequenced genomes. The <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC1933234-software-101">CRISPRFinder</rs> web interface is accessible through <rs type="url" corresp="#PMC1933234-software-101">http:// crispr.u-psud.fr/Server/CRISPRfinder.php</rs></p>
            <p><rs type="software">CRISPRFinder</rs> core routines were developed in Perl under Debian Linux. The input of the web tool is a genomic query sequence of length up to 67 Mb in 'FASTA' format. Possible locations of CRISPRs (consisting of at least one motif) are detected by finding maximal repeats. A maximal repeat <ref type="formula">26</ref>) is a repeat that cannot be extended in either direction without incurring a mismatch. The total number of maximal repeats in a sequence of size n is linear (less than n) which is interesting since the computation may be done in linear time using a suffix-tree-based algorithm. A CRISPR pattern of two DRs and a spacer may be considered as a maximal repeat where the repeated sequences are separated by a sequence of approximately the same length.</p>
            <p>The second step is aimed at retrieving the DR consensus of each cluster. The difficulty resides especially in the identification of boundaries, which is very important to extract the correct spacers and compare DRs. In fact, the consensus DR is selected as the maximal repeat which occurs the most in the whole underlying genome sequence with respect to the forward and the reverse complement directions (since two CRISPRs having the same DR consensus may be in opposite directions). Thus, ambiguity in the choice of a DR will be eliminated in the case of presence of similar DRs in other CRISPRs of the related genomic sequence. However, if occurrence numbers are equal, more than a single DR consensus candidate are kept and later compared. Given a candidate consensus DR, the pattern search program <rs type="software">fuzznuc</rs> of the <rs type="software">EMBOSS package</rs> ( <ref type="formula">28</ref>) is applied to get DRs' positions in the related cluster. As the first or the last DR in a CRISPR may be diverged/truncated, a mismatch of one-third of the DR length is allowed between the flanking DRs and the candidate consensus DR, whereas smaller nucleotide differences are allowed between the other DRs to take into account possible single mutations. In case of multiple DR candidates, a score is computed and the best one (minimum) is picked. This score favours candidates which are encountered more frequently, rather than consensus DR showing less internal mismatches.</p>
            <p>After querying a genomic sequence by <rs type="software">CRISPRFinder</rs>, results are summarized in a table with the number of confirmed and questionable CRISPRs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). A CRISPR locus is presented according to a colour code showing DRs in yellow and spacers in different colours. The respective positions are displayed, in addition to links to two files: a summary of the displayed properties (number of motifs, DR consensus, positions, etc.) and a fasta file containing the list of spacers. In addition, a PNG (Portable Network Graphics) figure displays the different candidates' location in the analysed sequence.  In the case of presence of CRISPR clusters, further analysis may be done through three hyperlinks in the left menu: (i) blast spacers against the Genbank databases with a cutoff of 0.1 for the E-value and a matching length of at least 70% the queried spacer size (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>); (ii) obtain CRISPR and flanking sequences which are especially useful to define the leader sequence. As the size of the leader sequence depends on the species (it varies from 100 to 500 bp), the retrieved sequence may be manually modified by the user (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>) and (iii) display identical DRs in other known CRISPR loci (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>). This utility corresponds to a link to CRISPR database (Grissa et al. submitted for publication).</p>
            <p>To check that <rs type="software">CRISPRFinder</rs> was efficient in recovering all the CRISPRs from a genome, we compared the results to other available studies on CRISPRs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20)</ref>. The data were generally in good agreement, the differences being always in the DR boundaries' identification (more accurate with <rs type="software">CRISPRFinder</rs>) or in the number of motifs found, as the truncated DR is sometimes neglected or short clusters are not detected with other programs. Interestingly, some strains were claimed to be devoid of CRISPRs by Godde and colleagues but proved to have short CRISPRs with <rs type="software">CRISPRFinder</rs>, such as in different Shigella sp. (S. sonnei Ss046, S. flexneri 2a str. 301, S. flexneri 2a str), or even long CRISPRs such as in Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14. The latter example is shown on the CRISPRfinder website (sample2), and as can be seen by using the BLAST spacer function, six spacers out of thirty six at two different CRISPR loci, correspond to a bacteriophage sequence (bacteriophages F116, B3, D3112, DMS3 and phi CTX).</p>
            <p>The <rs type="software">CRISPRFinder</rs> web server is an interface to extract with precision and to further analyse CRISPRs from genomic sequences. Four main advantages may be cited: (i) short CRISPR-like structures are detected, they are labelled questionable but may be of great interest if later confirmed; (ii) DRs are accurately defined to single base pair resolution; (iii) summary files may be uploaded (CRISPR properties summary and spacers file in Fasta format) and (iv) flanking sequences or spacers can be easily extracted and blasted against different databases.</p>
            <p>CRISPRs' in silico analyses started in 1995 (2) but no specific stand-alone CRISPR software tool was created. Several software were used by different authors to identify these particular repeats but usually a manual discard of background was necessary, and generally some CRISPR clusters were missed or neglected, especially the shortest one (less than three motifs). This is the case, for example, of <rs type="software">Tandem Repeat Finder</rs> (17) when considering a motif (DR &#254; spacer) as a degenerate repeat <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref>, or <rs type="software">Locating Uniform poly-Nucleotide Areas (LUNA)</rs>, a program for finding degenerate repeats in microbial genomes on a desktop computer. The repeats can be filtered using several parameters including length, distance and level of conservation. <rs type="software">LUNA</rs> was used especially for finding CRISPRs in archaea <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15)</ref>. Another program, <rs type="software">Patscan</rs> (<ref type="bibr">19</ref>) a pattern-matching tool that searches sequences fitting the introduced pattern, was applied.</p>

            <p>We have performed a simple experiment to explore: (1) our current knowledge of the universe of sequences, and how this knowledge has evolved in the past years, and (2) the possible extent of failures when taxonomically assigning ORFs to their closest relatives. Using the <rs type="software">Blast in Grids (BiG)</rs> service <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aparicio et al., 2007)</ref>, we have run <rs type="software">BLASTX</rs> searches for several metagenomes against the realease 159 (April 2007) of GenBank non-redundant protein database, extracted the homologues found for each putative ORF [following the procedure described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Tamames and Moya (2008)</ref>] and assigned the ORF to the taxon of its best hit (where different threshold of minimum identity have been used). Next, we have collected the dates of creation of the GenBank entries of these hits. In this way, we can simulate the results that we would have obtained in the past, by restricting the list of homologues to those already present in the database in a particular date, which allowed us to explore how the results change as the database grows. The experiment was repeated for different metagenomes and different taxonomic depths. One of the results is shown in the Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>, for a farm soil metagenome <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Tringe et al., 2005)</ref>. Each row corresponds to a single ORF, displaying the colour of the class to which it would have been assigned in different dates. The plot shows clearly that many of the assignments have changed, even in recent times (between 10% and 20% of the assignments at class level have varied in the last 2 years). This can be easily seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>, which shows the accumulated number of changes with respect to previous dates. Several trends are noticeable: (1) The rate of change does not decrease in recent times, instead it clearly increases for most cases. This trend of change can be noticed even for broad taxonomic ranks such as phylum: for instance, Acidobacteria phylum is now recognized as one of the most abundant taxa in many soils <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Barns et al., 1999)</ref>, but until recently no sequences were assigned to it. This indicates that the full diversity of these communities is still not well described in the current databases, and that best hit approach for taxonomic classification is at least risky. (2) Although most changes consist in the assignment of previously unclassified ORFs, the classification for many ORFs has also changed. (3) Abrupt changes occur in response to the availability of complete genomes, especially from close species to those represented in the metagenomes. Again for Acidobacteria, We analyzed 60 000 randomly selected sequences from the full metagenome, using blastx searches and a threshold of 60% minimum identity between query and hit proteins. Each row in the plot corresponds to a single ORF, showing with colours how the assignment has varied in time (colours indicate different taxonomic classes). (B) This plot shows the accumulated number of ORFs that changed their assignment between consecutive months (expressed as the ratio of number of changes/total number of ORFs), for different metagenomes (Blue, whale fall; Red, human gut; Green, farm soil; Black, Sargasso sea). The changes are divided between new assignments (the ORF was previously unassigned, dashed lines) and assignment changes (assignment to a different taxon, solid lines). The figure also emphasizes three dates in which many assignments change, in accordance to the release of particular complete genomes of importance for the description of these microbial communities.</p>

            <p>The EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) offers public access to patent sequence data, providing a valuable service to the intellectual property and scientific communities. The non-redundant (NR) patent sequence databases comprise two-level nucleotide and protein sequence clusters (NRNL1, NRNL2, NRPL1 and NRPL2) based on sequence identity (level-1) and patent family (level-2). Annotation from the source entries in these databases is merged and enhanced with additional information from the patent literature and biological context. Corrections in patent publication numbers, kind-codes and patent equivalents significantly improve the data quality. Data are available through various user interfaces including web browser, downloads via FTP, SRS, Dbfetch and EBI-Search. Sequence similarity/homology searches against the databases are available using <rs type="software">BLAST</rs>, <rs type="software">FASTA</rs> and <rs type="software">PSI-Search</rs>. In this article, we describe the data collection and annotation and also outline major changes and improvements introduced since 2009. Apart from data growth, these changes include additional annotation for singleton clusters, the identifier versioning for tracking entry change and the entry mappings between the two-level databases.</p>

            <p>To determine miRNA scores, the mean fold change of all the miRNAs belonging to each specific analysis (D-HF vs. CTR, ND-HF vs. CTR, and ND-HF vs. D-HF) was calculated for each patient and the minus sign was inverted before calculating the mean. Bioinformatic analysis. Bioinformatic prediction of miRNA target genes was performed using <rs type="software">miRonTop</rs> <ref type="bibr">(26,27)</ref>. Predicted miRNA target genes were compared with differently expressed genes (P # 0.01) displaying an opposite modulation with their corresponding miRNA.

            <p>Next, experimentally validated and predicted targets of each miRNA were analyzed, and mRNA/miRNA couples displaying reciprocal modulation were selected. Statistical analysis allowed the identification of 140, 329, and 11 miRNA/mRNA interactions in the D-HF versus CTR, ND-HF versus CTR, and D-HF versus ND-HF groups, respectively (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). A subset of the identified miRNAtarget modulations was further validated by qRT-PCR in cardiac biopsies (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>) and in a cell culture system (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Gene interaction and pathway analysis of global gene expression changes. To facilitate the interpretation of the complex gene expression changes observed in the different experimental groups, we used <rs type="software">Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (IPA)</rs>, exploring for enriched biological functions and pathways. We applied a low-stringency approach, prioritizing sensitivity to maximize the identification of the potentially involved categories.</p>

            <p>To search for ENC orthologs in sequenced invertebrate genomes, we explored public databases. Predicted peptide sequences of Nematostella vectensis, Trichoplax adherens, Helobdella robusta, Capitella teleta, Lottia gigantea, Daphnia pulex, Branchiostoma floridae (all accessible at the DOE Joint Genome Institute: http://www.jgi.doe.gov/, last accessed July 24, 2013) and of Schistosoma mansoni (ftp://ftp.sanger. ac.uk/pub/pathogens/Schistosoma/mansoni/genome/gene_ predictions/, last accessed July 24, 2013) were downloaded, and local <rs type="software">Blast</rs> searches using human ENC1 protein as query were performed. Invertebrate sequences with high similarity scores were included in the phylogenetic analysis (fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p>
            <p>We analyzed the genomic regions up to 10 Mb flanking the three chicken ENC genes to search for conserved intragenomic synteny as instructed by <ref type="bibr">Kuraku and Meyer (2012)</ref>. Using the <rs type="software">Ensembl</rs> "Gene Tree," we selected only pairs, triplets, or quartets of paralogous genes that show a gene duplication pattern in accordance with the 2R-WGD <ref type="bibr">(Dehal and Boore 2005)</ref>. The conserved synteny is depicted in figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>.</p>
            <p>Because the chicken ENC3 gene sequence was incomplete with a stretch of "N"s in the open reading frame (ORF) of ENSGALG00000024263 (Ensembl genome database: http:// www.ensembl.org, last accessed July 24, 2013; release 64; <ref type="bibr">Hubbard et al. 2009</ref>), we performed a reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR with gene-specific primers and sequenced the missing part. By aligning the overlapping regions of the deduced protein sequences of the newly obtained fragment and the incomplete sequence in <rs type="software">Ensembl</rs>, we detected an amino acid substitution. The comparison with other vertebrate ENC proteins clearly showed that this is a highly conserved residue (asparagine). Therefore, we assume that the lysine residue of the Ensembl chicken ENC3 protein was caused by a sequencing error, which is also plausible with respect to the stretch of "N"s. The curated cDNA fragment is deposited in EMBL under accession number HE981758.</p>

            <p>A 123-base pair (bp) segment of human &#946;-globin gene was used as amplification control to ascertain the quality of the DNA, as described previously <ref type="bibr">(11)</ref>. For detection of MCPyV DNA, LT3 primer which is very specific for amplification of the MCPyV T antigen (TAg) sequence was used <ref type="bibr">(3)</ref>. All primers were synthesized by Metabion International AG (Martinsried, Germany). Merkel Cell Polyomavirus DNA was detected in both tumors of patient (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> A) and 309 bp putative PCR product was cloned into the pTZ57R/T PCR cloning vector (InsTAclone&#8482; PCR cloning Kit, Fermentas, MD, USA), then submitted for sequencing (Bioneer, Daejeon, South Korea). The sequences were aligned with reference sequences of MCPyV (MCC350, MCC339, TKS, MKL-1) using the National Center for Biotechnology Information Blast algorithm. The sequences were deposited in GenBank with the Accession Numbers KF442250 and KF442251. The results of sequence alignment showed that they were 100% identical to those of the MCC339 and MKL-1 isolates.</p>

            <p>The short genomic reads used in the study are deposited at DDBJ-SRA under accession ID PRJDB4103. The scaffolds for the Hordeum vulgare cv. Haruna Nijo are available at http://barleyflc.dna.affrc.go.jp/ bexdb/pages/harunanijo_index.jsp for download. Genome browsing of the Haruna Nijo gene models are available on <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC4755524-software-100">GBrowse</rs> [(<rs type="url" corresp="#PMC4755524-software-100">http:// gmod.org/wiki/GBrowse</rs>) <ref type="bibr">38</ref> at http://barleyflc.dna.affrc.go.jp/gb2/ gbrowse/HarunaNijo_genome/.21]. All scaffolds were concatenated by 100 'Ns' from the longer scaffolds. Haruna Nijo scaffolds, FLcDNAs, RNA-Seq genes, repeat information, Morex contigs and Morex HC/LC genes are displayed (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). From the Haruna Nijo genome browser, FLcDNA annotation data and Morex genome browser of bex-db could be accessed (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). Moreover, users can access the Haruna Nijo genome from FLcDNA information of bex-db.</p>
            <p>FLcDNA mapping on genome sequence provides reliable exon vs. intron structures on gene models. A non-redundant set of 28,620 FLcDNA sequences <ref type="bibr">13,14</ref> was mapped to the Haruna Nijo scaffolds. <rs type="software">Blastn</rs> mapping revealed that 27,784 FLcDNAs (97%) showed sequence similarities with the Haruna Nijo scaffolds. According to the results of the FLcDNA mapping to scaffolds, we analysed mapping coverage of 5&#8242;-end of each FLcDNA on Haruna Nijo scaffolds. The ratio of completely mapped FLcDNAs, which were mapped from the first nucleotide sequence, was &lt;10%. This shows that most of the FLcDNAs do not have the complete sequences on the 5&#8242;-end side exon. To analyse additional mapped FLcDNAs, we relaxed the mapping position to the first 10 nucleotide sequences. Then, the ratio of mapped FLcDNA was raised to 80% (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S3</ref>). GC contents and CG-skew were analysed on the FLcDNAs having mapped 5&#8242;-ends within 10 bp. The typical high GC contents and CG-skewed peaks at the transcription start sites were identified as previously observed in rice and Arabidopsis 32 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S4</ref>).</p>
            <p>2.5. FLcDNA/RNA-Seq mapping 2.5.1. FLcDNA mapping Of the two independent projects, 13,14 5,006 FLcDNAs were retrieved from NCBI <ref type="bibr">13</ref> and 23,614 FLcDNAs <ref type="bibr">14</ref> were downloaded from the bex-db (http://barleyflc.dna.affrc.go.jp/bexdb/). <ref type="bibr">21</ref> Morex genome assembly (contigs) was retrieved from the PGSB PlantsDB database (http://pgsb.helmholtz-muenchen.de/plant/plantsdb.jsp, 7 November 2015, date accessed). <ref type="bibr">3</ref> FLcDNAs were mapped both on the Haruna Nijo scaffolds and on the Morex contigs using <rs type="software">blast+</rs> with the parameters '-task blastn -evalue 10e &#8722;10 -lcase_masking', and with est2genome <ref type="bibr">22</ref> in the EMBOSS package with the parameters '-align -mode both -gappenalty 8 -mismatch 6 -minscore 10'. FLcDNAs mapped to scaffolds with &gt;95% identity and &gt;50% coverage were accepted. Mapped regions with the highest identity were adopted for each FLcDNA. Overlapped FLcDNA sequences were clustered onto a locus on Haruna Nijo genome.</p>
            <p>tRNAs were also annotated by tRNAscan-SE. The spectrum of tRNA distribution across the genome was uneven but similar to the rice genome <ref type="bibr">37</ref> (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>). It is reported that tRNA Lys sequences are extraordinarily abundant in wheat chromosome 6B due to the abundance of the retrotransposon Gypsy. <ref type="bibr">35</ref> The Haruna Nijo scaffolds also have higher rate of Gypsy; however, the number of tRNAs was smaller than that in wheat.</p>
            <p>From the silva database <ref type="bibr">29</ref> (http://www.arb-silva.de/, 7 November 2015, date accessed), 17 barley rRNA sequences were downloaded. They were mapped on the Haruna Nijo scaffolds using <rs type="software">blast+</rs> with the parameters '-task blastn -evalue 0.01 -lcase_masking -num_descriptions 100' and blast hits with &gt;98% identity and &gt;50% coverage were assumed as rRNAs. tRNA genes were predicted using the tRNAscan-SE ver. 1.3.1 program. <ref type="bibr">30</ref> Any tRNAs that were annotated as 'possible pseudogenes' were not counted.</p>
            <p>Human, fungi (33 species) and microbial (2,777 species) nucleotide sequence data were obtained from NCBI. Each assembled contig sequence was queried on sequences of these species, and the contigs showing &gt;80% identity and &gt;50% of cumulative coverage by blastn <ref type="bibr">16</ref> were assumed as alien sequences against the barley genome. For repeat masking, fasta files of Triticeae repeat sequence database (TREP Release 10: n = 1,717) were downloaded from GrainGenes (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/ITMI/ Repeats/, 7 November 2015, date accessed). In addition, new repetitive elements were generated from the Haruna Nijo genome assembly by <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC4755524-software-101">RepeatModeler</rs> (<rs type="url" corresp="#PMC4755524-software-100">http://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler.html</rs>, 7 November 2015, date accessed). These two libraries were used for repeat masking the Haruna Nijo assembly by censor <ref type="bibr">17</ref> with -mode norm mode. For the analysis of repeat distribution, only results of repeat masking by the  <rs type="software">TREP library</rs> were used. For comparison, genomes of Triticum aestivum, <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Triticum urartu <ref type="bibr">19</ref> and Aegilops tauschii <ref type="bibr">20</ref> were repeat masked in a similar manner as the Haruna Nijo genome.</p>
            <p>After trimming of low-quality nucleotide and adapter sequences by <rs type="software">Trimmomatic</rs>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> reads derived from rRNA sequences were discarded by <rs type="software">Bowtie2</rs>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> A set of programs, <rs type="software">Bowtie2</rs>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> <rs type="software">TopHat2</rs> <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> and <rs type="software">Cufflinks</rs>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> were used to map reads on the Haruna Nijo scaffolds. Gene structures derived from FLcDNA mapping were utilized to develop consensus gene models of the four library reads. To predict ORFs on the gene structures, <rs type="software">blastx</rs> searches were conducted to Re-fSeq and UniProtKB data sets. From the best hit of <rs type="software">blastx</rs> results, the most reliable ORFs were determined with at least 70 amino acids in length. To assign gene function, <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC4755524-software-102">InterProScan</rs> <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC4755524-software-102">5</rs> <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> was conducted on the predicted ORFs. Based on the InterPro domain, GO terms were assigned to each ORF, and GOslim 28 (http://agbase. msstate.edu/cgi-bin/tools/goslimviewer_select.pl, 7 November 2015, date accessed) was conducted.</p>
            <p>The shotgun library was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 to produce 2 &#215; 101 paired-end reads. Raw data processing, base calling and quality control were performed with manufacture's standard pipeline. The quality of the output sequences was inspected using the FastQC program (http://www.bioinformatics.bbsrc.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/, 7 November 2015, date accessed).</p>
            <p>Illimina PE reads, 454 single-end reads and 454 long paired-end reads were hybrid assembled by the de novo assemble algorithm of CLC Assembly Cell ver. 3.2.2 installed on a linux server with a main memory of 256 Gb.</p>

            <p>The study was done under <rs type="software">CARTO 3D</rs> electroanatomic mapping guidance, keeping the possibility of epicardial pathway (as recent attempts of ablation by conventional mapping failed). The study was carried out with one quadripolar catheter for the His region and one mapping catheter. Orthrodromic reentrant tachycardia (ORT) was easily and repeatedly induced with programmed extrastimulation, with a cycle length of 350msecs. Mapping was performed during sinus rhythm (SR) as well as during tachycardia. Earliest atrial activation during ORT was in right anterolateral region. Good signals were obtained with fused A and V in a relatively broad area in anterolateral tricuspid annulus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). However, multiple radiofrequency (RF) energies (10e30 s; 43 ; 30 W) at these sites, using 3.5 mm tip, 7.5F (Biosense Webster's Navistar, D curve) catheter failed to terminate the tachycardia.</p>

            <p>In summary, in our view, the transfer of the POL principle to virtual reality is possible and we judge the first results as a success for the students, teachers and the subject of nuclear medicine overall. Although the POL approach is time-intensive, in particular for teachers and students and created technical problems initially, the described concept has the potential for wider communication of basic knowledge in nuclear medicine. However, it seems difficult, especially in the group phase, to operate purely on virtual interaction between the students as the limitations of this communication form were felt to be difficult, so that in four of the five seminars face-to-face meetings of the students also took place. It remains to be seen whether this can be overcome by the growing online socialisation of students or whether the seminar consequently will be limited to the study site to continue to enable personal contact. Nevertheless, we view virtual POL seminars as an interesting addition to teaching which make it possible to interest motivated students in the subject of nuclear medicine and in the medium, perhaps to win over <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[14]</ref>. To achieve this, it must be discussed in the following how the widest possible involvement of students can be achieved. In the pilot courses conducted by us, which were primarily about the feasibility of virtual POL and first experiences, the seminar was completely voluntary and, in comparison to the number of students who access the moodle site, relatively little used. This experience is consistent with those of the working group on "Computerassisted teaching and learning systems in medicine" in of the German Society for Medical Computer Science, Biometry and Epidemiology (GMDS), which reports that only about 5% of students took advantage of the available e-learning systems as part of their self-studies [quoted from <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>]. A study on the case-based CASUS system points out that a main reason for the lack of student use of e-learning is linked to the lack of relevance to the students. In the Munich study, cases were worked upon by all students as soon as this was linked to "credit points" and thus relevant for the students' exams. In case of pure self-study, where no credits were awarded, this occurred with only 10% of students <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>. It is likely that these conclusions also apply to virtual POL. In the coming semesters an attempt will be therefore to anchor the POL seminar in teaching more strongly, for example by approaching interested students in the presence seminars or on the moodle course "Molecular Imaging" already. In the longer term, we are considering the introduction of structural changes by integrating the course in the curriculum and extending it beyond the specialist subject of nuclear medicine to the full range of diagnostic imaging, in particular radiology. In doing so, the course would not only become more attractive to students but for the teaching staff it could become a focal point for new approaches to teaching that go beyond one's own subject.</p>

            <p>Secondary structures of TTLL12 wild-type and new 36AA plus isoform. Secondary structures of the TTLL12 wild-type and TTLL12 36AA plus isoform were predicted by <rs type="publisher" corresp="#PMC5112610-software-102">DNAStar</rs> <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC5112610-software-102">Protean</rs> and online tool <rs type="software">CFSSP</rs>. As a result, the total residues of &#945;-Helix , &#946;-sheet and &#946;-turn in the TTLL12 wild-type were 476, 428 and 72, and the corresponding percentages were 73.9, 66.5 and 11.2%, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">6A</ref>). While total residues of &#945;-Helix, &#946;-sheet and &#946;-turn in the TTLL12 36AA plus isoformwere 504, 455 and 75, and the corresponding percentages were 74.1, 66.9 and 11.0%, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">6B</ref>). The results showed that the proportions of different types of secondary structures in these two TTLL12 proteins were slightly different (Table <ref type="table">II</ref>).</p>
            <p>The additional 36AA is involved in a disordered region of TTLL12. To ascertain whether the additional 36AA in the TTLL12 36AA plus isoform is in a disordered region of TTLL12, we firstly sought the disordered regions of the TTLL12 36AA plus isoform by the opening accessible online resources DisProt search, and found that the peptide of 260AA to 299AA in the TTLL12 36AA plus isoform was highly identical to the disordered region of Bcl-2-like protein 11 (B2L11) (Fig. <ref type="figure">7A</ref>), suggesting this peptide could act as a disordered region in thethat the additional 36AA was partly identical to the disordered region of brain natriuretic peptide-32 (BNP-32) (Fig. <ref type="figure">7B</ref>), giving the possibility that the 36AA could endow TTLL12 with new functions by acting as part of the disordered region. However, the biological functions of the new TTLL12 isoform in cancers remain to be further investigated.</p>

            <p>To determine the sensitivity of TNBC cell lines and T47D to EGFR inhibition, MET inhibition, and combined therapy inhibition, breast cancer cell lines were treated with gefitinib (0.25-8 umol/L), EMD 121463 (2-10 umol/L), or both agents given at the same concentration in combination for 72 hours. GI 50 of these cell lines were 1-5 uM to gefitinib and 4uM-&#8805;10uM to EMD 121463. These cell lines were essentially resistant to both gefitinib and EMD 121463 as single agents. The inhibitory effect of combined treatment with gefitinib and EMD 121463 was significantly enhanced compared with single agent therapy in MDA-MB-468 cells (P=0.002) but not in the other cell lines (MDA-MB-231, HCC1395, and T47D) (Fig <ref type="figure">1</ref>). However, when data were analyzed in <rs type="software">Calcusyn</rs> software, synergism was also documented at different concentration combinations in the other cell lines (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).

            <p>We examined the effects of ABT-737 alone or in combination with Bortezomib for treating A375 and WM852c human melanoma cells using MTS assays to measure relative cell viability. We found that ABT-737 alone at 1.1 mM caused no cytotoxicity, consistent with results shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>, but ABT-737 increased the effect of Bortezomib on relative cell viability (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A,B</ref>). To quantify whether these drug combinations exhibited synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effects, we used <rs type="software">Calcusyn</rs> software to calculate the combination index (CI) value for each experimental combination (supplementary material Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>). CI values less than, equal to, or greater than one indicate synergy, additivity, or antagonism, respectively. Most of the CI values were less than 0.7 (indicating synergy), and many CI values were less than 0.3 (indicating strong synergy). These results show that a majority of the combination conditions of ABT-737 with Bortezomib displayed strong synergistic killing effects for these melanoma cell lines (supplementary material Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).

The indication for the ICD implantation was secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death in 37 (90%) patients and primary prevention in 4 (10%) patients. Thirty patients (73%) had prior myocardial infarction and 5 (12%) had dilated cardiomyopathy. Most of the patients were in stable clinical condition as only one patient (2%) had New York Heart Association III symptoms and no patients were in class IV (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). The most common symptoms at study inclusion included occasional dyspnoea (32%) and palpitations (34%).

            <p>In this study, we report the first experiences in Europe with the Medtronic CareLink TM system. The system consists of a portable patient monitor, a central database in a secure server, and a password-protected website, where clinicians can view and analyse patient's device data (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Our aim was to provide comprehensive data on the safety, clinical practicability, and cost-effectiveness of remote ICD monitoring in an area characterized by long travelling distances to the device clinic. The economic impact of remote ICD monitoring was evaluated by comparing the direct and indirect costs of remote follow-up to those of standard clinical practice.</p>

            <p>To further confirm the inhibitory effect of Hath1 on KUMA5 cells, the rate of apoptosis was examined by Annexin V and PI staining of KUMA5 cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1-Hath1, pGenesil-1-Hath1, pGenesil-1 scramble control or a blank control. FITC-Annexin V and PI were added to the fixed cells for 20 min in darkness at room temperature. Subsequently, Annexin V binding buffer was added to the mixture prior to measuring the fluorescence using a FACSort flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Cell apoptosis was analyzed using <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC4758284-software-100">CellQuest</rs> <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC4758284-software-100">3.0</rs> software (<rs type="publisher" corresp="#PMC4758284-software-100">Becton Dickinson</rs>). The results demonstrated that a significantly higher rate of apoptosis was present in the KUMA5 cells overexpressing Hath1 compared with that of the control groups (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). In addition, a significantly lower rate of apoptosis was observed in the KUMA5 cells transfected with pGenesil-1-Hath1 compared with that of the control groups (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). Therefore, these results suggest that overexpression of Hath1 may promote apoptosis in KUMA5 cells.</p>

Cells harvested from the cultures were stained with the following monoclonal antibodies (mAbs): FITC-conjugated mouse anti-human CD1a mAb (clone NA1/34-HLK, Serotec, Oxford, U.K.), rat anti-canine MHC class II mAb (clone YKIX.334.2, Serotec), PE-Cy5-conjugated mouse anti-human CD14 mAb (clone T&#220;K4, Serotec), biotin conjugated rat anti-mouse CD80 mAb (clone 1G10, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, U.S.A.) and mouse anti-human CD86 mAb (clone FUN-1, Becton Dickinson). Staining with biotin conjugated mAb was followed by incubation with streptavidin-PerCP-Cy5.5 (Becton Dickinson). Before staining, the anti-CD86 mAb was labeled by PE conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probe) for 5 min at room temperature. The excess of PE-goat anti-mouse IgG was neutralized by excess purified mouse IgG (Sigma). After the staining, the cells were fixed and analyzed using a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur&#8482;: Becton Dickinson). Background of the fluorescence was adjusted using following isotype-control: FITC-conjugated mouse IgG2a (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, U.S.A.), FITCconjugated rat IgG2a (eBioscience) and biotin-conjugated rat IgG2a (eBioscience).

            <p>Aristolochic acids (AAs) are the active components of herbal drugs derived from Aristolochia species that have been used for medicinal purposes since antiquity. However, AAs have recently been discovered to be highly nephrotoxic and induced urothelial cancer in humans and malignant tumors in the kidney and urinary tract of rodents. In this study, we exposed rat renal proximal tubule cells in vitro to a sub-cytotoxic level of AAs at three different time points (6 h, 24 h and 72 h). We then analyzed the gene expression profile after the compound exposure. Functional analysis with <rs type="software">Ingenuity Pathways Analysis</rs> and <rs type="software">DAVID</rs> tools revealed that at the late time point (72 h) there are many significantly altered genes involved in cancer-related pathways such as p53 signaling. MIAMI-compliant microarray data are deposited in the NCBI GEO database under accession number GSE68687 and can be found at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68687.</p>
            <p>The intensity values of different genes (probe sets) generated by <rs type="software">Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software</rs> were imported into <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC4584013-software-100">GeneSpring</rs>   version <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC4584013-software-100">11</rs> software (<rs type="publisher" corresp="#PMC4584013-software-100">Agilent</rs>) for data analysis. The raw data files (CEL files) containing signal values for individual probes were pre-processed to generate one value per probeset. Pre-processing of arrays was done using GC-RMA (Robust Multiarray Analysis algorithm). To identify the differentially expressed (DE) probe sets, two sampled t-test (unpaired t-test) with a P-value b 0.05 and Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing correction and a fold cut off of 2 was used. Comparisons were made between control DMSO-exposed and AA-exposed cells. Three studies were conducted at each time point.</p>

            <p>Bisulfite pyrosequencing was performed on a PyroMark Q96 MD Pyrosequencing System with the PyroMark Gold Q96 CDT Reagent kit (Qiagen). An assay quantifying the methylation levels of five representative CpG sites in the BRCA1 promoter was designed using the <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC3329502-software-100">PyroMark Assay Design</rs> <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC3329502-software-100">2.0</rs> software (<rs type="publisher" corresp="#PMC3329502-software-100">Qiagen</rs>). A 232 bp amplicon (HSA17: 41,277,292-41,277,523 bps; Ensembl release 60) was PCR amplified from bisulfitetreated DNA using forward primer 5'-ATT TAG AGT AGA GGG TGA AGG-3' and biotinylated reverse primer 5'-TCT ATC CCT CCC ATC CTC TAA TT-3'. The reaction mixture consisted of 2.5 &#956;l 10x PCR buffer, 20 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5 &#956;l 10 mM dNTP mix, 1 &#956;l (10 pmol) of each primer, 0.2 &#956;l (1 U) FastStart Taq DNA Polymerase (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), 18.8 &#956;l PCR-grade water and 1 &#956;l (~100 ng) template DNA. PCR amplifications were performed with an initial denaturation step at 95&#176;C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 95&#176;C for 30 sec, 55&#176;C for 30 sec and 72&#176;C for 45 sec and a final extension step at 72&#176;C for 5 min.

For Sanger sequencing of the 5' UTR and exon 1 of the BRCA1 gene, a 3.4 kb fragment on chromosome 17 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(41,</ref><ref type="bibr">277,</ref><ref type="bibr">280</ref>,530 bps, Ensembl release 64) was divided into 11 amplicons (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). For amplicons 1-5 and 8, the PCR reaction mixture (25 &#956;l) consisted of 2.5 &#956;l 10x PCR buffer, 20 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5 &#956;l 10 mM dNTP mix, 1 &#956;l (10 pmol) of each forward and reverse primer, 0. the cytoplasmic pellet and stored at -80&#176;C. The protein concentration was measured according to Bradford, using Roti Quant (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). Customized antibody microarrays for quantification of BRCA1 (antibody #sc-1553, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) and several other DNA repair-associated proteins (ATM, BRCA2, MLH1, RAD51 and TP53) were prepared by spotting triplicate drops, each containing approximately 0.5 pg antibody onto nitrocellulose-coated slides (Oncyte, nitrocellulose 16 multi-pad slides, Grace Bio-Labs, Bend, OR), using a sciFLEX-ARRAYER 3 non-contact spotter (Scienion, Berlin, Germany). Antibodies against &#946;-actin (ACTB) (#A5441, Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) served as positive, spotting buffer as negative control. Slides were stored at 4&#176;C in dry condition. Nuclear proteins were labeled with an amine reactive fluorine dye, which forms a covalent amide bond between the primary amines of proteins. Two micrograms of protein and 0.12 &#956;l fluorescent dye (Dylight 649 NHS Ester, Pierce, Rockford, IL) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Then, excess fluorescent dye was inactivated by adding 100 mM glycine to the reaction. Prior to use, antibody microarrays were covered with 16-pad FAST frame hybridization chambers (Whatman, Maidstone, UK). Unspecific binding sites were blocked for 1 h at 4&#176;C with 120 &#956;l PBS containing 4% non-fat dry milk per subarray, followed by three washes with 120 &#956;l PBS each for 10 min. Labeled protein samples were incubated on subarrays overnight at 4&#176;C. Afterwards, the slides were washed two times for 15 min with PBS, 5% Tween 20 and two times for 15 min with HPLC-grade water. Finally, the slides were dried in a SpeedVac and scanned with a high-resolution confocal Affymetrix array scanner 428 TM (Affymetrix, High Wycombe, UK). Slide images were analyzed using the <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC3329502-software-101">TM4 Spotfinder</rs> (version <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC3329502-software-101">3.1.1</rs>) software (<rs type="publisher" corresp="#PMC3329502-software-101">Dana Faber Cancer Institute</rs>, Boston, MA). Background subtraction was performed according to the formula: spot intensity = mean intensity SP -[(sum bkg -sum top25 bkg)/(number of pixelSP -number of pixel top25 bkg)], where SP represents any spot, bkg the corresponding background and top25 bkg the top 25% of background pixel. Microarray data were analyzed using log10 transformation, z score and z ratio calculations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">47</ref> Three biological replicates (using protein samples from different cell cultures of the affected and the healthy twin) were performed for each experiment.</p>

We analyzed three different ranges of target abundance, average no PreAmp Cq value less than 30, between 30 and 32.5, and greater than 32.5. The limit of detection was estimated as 2-fold the 95% confidence interval. For example, if the fold-change 95% confidence interval for targets between 30 and 32.5 was calculated as 1.0Cq, then 2-fold this value is 2.0Cq, which represents a 4-fold change. Therefore, targets with a no PreAmp Cq value between 30 and 32.5 have a 4-fold change limit of detection.</p>

            <p>The research in which I have been involved draws on data from nontraditional sources: contacts with financial journalists and leads from consulting. The data on the hundreds of executives who were being spun by Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB, now known as just Credit Suisse), come from a government exhibit that was introduced in the prosecution of CSFB executive Frank Quattrone on obstructionof-justice charges. I became aware of the data when a financial journalist alerted me to the existence of the exhibit, an Excel spreadsheet that listed the name, corporate position, company, and a CSFB spinning priority code for individuals being spun as of March 2000, at the peak of the technology stock bubble. These accounts were popularly known as "Friend of Frank" accounts. This list was augmented by a separate list of 63 Friend of Frank accountholders who lived in Silicon Valley that ran in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">March 7, 2003</ref>, edition of the San Jose Mercury-News. This list, which included the names of executives of companies that had gone public after March 2000, overlapped with the names on the Excel spreadsheet, and contained the number of IPOs each executive received and the first-day profits on these allocations.</p>

            <p>To deal with these challenges, Middlebury has recently created a PoP program. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The program grew out of the existing Executive in Residence program, but expanded it significantly and made it much more focused on teaching, and on bringing the executives into the classroom than was the case previously. The PoP program is built on the assumption that the best people to teach the skills needed in a career are the people who have been successful in that career. So the PoP program brings in successful people who are at a point in their career when they want to give back to society by teaching students how the liberal arts are used in the real world. It pairs these professors of the practice with academic liberal arts professor sponsors. These sponsors work with the professors of the practice on teaching the course. They do so by giving the PoP suggestions and guidance in teaching. The sponsor's role is to insure that the course both maintains academic rigor and asks broad liberal arts questions in addition to providing contextual knowledge of the field being taught. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> For example, in Middlebury's accounting and budgeting course, students go back to Luigi Pacioli's introduction of double entry bookkeeping and consider how its general adoption fundamentally changed society. They also consider how accounting might change for triple bottom line corporations. In finance, in addition to becoming facile with dcf models in <rs type="software">Excel</rs>, students consider the evolution of financial ideas over the last 50 years and how developments in the science of finance changed the practice of finance, not necessarily for the better.</p>

            <p>To study the origin and progression of plateaus, the most recent SD-OCT with this signature was identified. Then, serial eye-tracked B-scans of the region of interest were tracked back to baseline. In cases in which the scanning protocol varied during the course of follow-up, the B-scan closest to the area of interest was matched manually and extracted for analysis. These extracted SD-OCT images were then stacked, aligned, and saved as a video file using the <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC5413303-software-100">Fiji</rs> distribution (''Fiji is just Image J,'' <rs corresp="#PMC5413303-software-100" type="url">http://fiji.sc</rs>; in the public domain) <ref type="bibr">22</ref> for the qualitative analysis of the progression of the lesion (see Supplementary Video).

            <p>Statistical analysis was carried out using the <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC4215532-software-100">R</rs> programming language (<rs corresp="#PMC4215532-software-100" type="publisher">R Core Team</rs>, 2012), version <rs corresp="#PMC4215532-software-100" type="version">2.15.1</rs>, on R-Cloud built on EBI 64bit Linux Cluster <ref type="bibr">(Kapushesky et al., 2010)</ref>. Demographic and clinical features were compared using parametric and non-parametric tests as appropriate. Principal component analysis (PCA) from the <rs type="software">R 'base' package</rs> was used with visual inspection of PCA score-plot for the outlier detection <ref type="bibr">(Esbensen et al., 2002)</ref>. One subject was excluded during this procedure (see Results). The <rs type="software">'randomForest' package</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Liaw and Wiener, 2002)</ref> was used in further analysis.</p>
            <p>Image processing was performed at one site: Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences, IoP (KCL). Image quality control was performed using standardized procedures <ref type="bibr">(Simmons et al., 2011; Simmons et al., 2009)</ref>. Next, the raw 3D T1 MRI data underwent processing for surface-based cortex reconstruction and volumetric segmentation using the <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC4215532-software-101">Freesurfer</rs> image analysis software (<rs corresp="#PMC4215532-software-101" type="url">http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/</rs>) version <rs corresp="#PMC4215532-software-101" type="version">5.1</rs> installed on a CentOS4 x86_64 cluster. There are several rationales for using <rs type="software">Freesurfer</rs> in our study. Firstly, the surface-based registration approach incorporated into this software has been shown to have better reproducibility compared to Laplacian-or Registration-based methods for cortical thickness estimation <ref type="bibr">(Clarkson et al., 2011)</ref>. Secondly, this framework provides a range of different kinds of surface-based and volumetric measurements, as well as different parcellation atlases for extracting averaged morphometric data. The steps of this processing are described in detail elsewhere <ref type="bibr">(S&#233;gonne et al., 2007; S&#233;gonne et al., 2004; Fischl and Dale, 2000; Fischl et al., 1999; Dale et al., 1999; Sled et al., 1998)</ref>.</p>
            <p>The following parameters from the final models were reported to characterize performance: out-of-bag error (for the term definition see <ref type="bibr">Breiman, 2001)</ref>, area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity/specificity and overall accuracy on the testing datasets of AD, HC and MCI subjects (see "Subsampling"). ROC-curves of the best models were compared using DeLong3s test for two correlated ROCs, as implemented in the 'pROC' R-package <ref type="bibr">(Robin et al., 2011)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Computer-aided diagnosis of Alzheimer3s disease (AD) is a rapidly developing field of neuroimaging with strong potential to be used in practice. In this context, assessment of models3 robustness to noise and imaging protocol differences together with post-processing and tuning strategies are key tasks to be addressed in order to move towards successful clinical applications. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of Random Forest classifiers trained using different structural MRI measures, with and without neuroanatomical constraints in the detection and prediction of AD in terms of accuracy and between-cohort robustness. From The ADNI database, 185 AD, and 225 healthy controls (HC) were randomly split into training and testing datasets. 165 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were distributed according to the month of conversion to dementia (4-year follow-up). Structural 1.5-T MRI-scans were processed using <rs type="software">Freesurfer</rs> segmentation and cortical reconstruction. Using the resulting output, AD/HC classifiers were trained. Training included model tuning and performance assessment using out-of-bag estimation. Subsequently the classifiers were validated on the AD/HC test set and for the ability to predict MCI-to-AD conversion. Models3 between-cohort robustness was additionally assessed using the AddNeuroMed dataset acquired with harmonized clinical and imaging protocols. In the ADNI set, the best AD/HC sensitivity/specificity (88.6%/92.0%test set) was achieved by combining cortical thickness and volumetric measures. The Random Forest model resulted in significantly higher accuracy compared to the reference classifier (linear Support Vector Machine). The models trained using parcelled and highdimensional (HD) input demonstrated equivalent performance, but the former was more effective in terms of computation/memory and time costs. The sensitivity/specificity for detecting MCI-to-AD conversion (but not AD/HC classification performance) was further improved from 79.5%/75%-83.3%/81.3% by a combination of morphometric measurements with ApoE-genotype and demographics (age, sex, education). When applied to the independent AddNeuroMed cohort, the best ADNI models produced equivalent performance without substantial accuracy drop, suggesting good robustness sufficient for future clinical implementation.</p>
            <p>The surface-based pipeline produced several morphometric modalities (cortical thickness, Jacobian maps, and sulcal depth). After the <rs type="software">Freesurfer</rs> steps, cortical models from each individual were registered to a spherical atlas, providing matching across subjects, and finally 327,684 normalized measurements acquired for every subject were concatenated into large matrices (one for each high-dimensional morphometric modality).</p>
            <p>To investigate the effect of different atlases, we selected cortical thickness as a measurement type that produced the most accurate models and applied two parcellations implemented in the <rs type="software">Freesurfer</rs> package -Desikan-Killiany (DK) and Destrieux (D) atlasesto extract averaged values from the predefined regions.</p>
            <p>PCA-based outlier detection revealed one subject, whose <rs type="software">Freesurfer</rs> output was corrupted and was therefore excluded from the subsequent analysis.</p>
            <p>Data collection and sharing for this project was funded by the Alzheimer3s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (National Institutes of Health grant U01 AG024904). <ref type="bibr">ADNI</ref>   It starts and proceeds in two directions aimed at extraction of parcelled and highdimensional measurements using <rs type="software">Freesurfer</rs> software (blue box). After this part had completed, the extracted measures underwent steps for outlier detection, and the resulted output was used in further Random Forest classification runs (in R programming language gray box). We additionally tuned our models using recursive feature elimination and m try -parameter adjustment (which defines the number of predictors randomly sampled at each node of the classifier). Finally, feature importance vectors from the best models were either mapped into the brain space (for the high-dimensional data) or plotted (for the parcelled input). We are very thankful to EMBL-EBI Community for the provided R-could account and personally to Andrew Tikhonov for his incredibly valuable help and technical input while working with <rs type="software">rWorkbench</rs>. We would also like to acknowledge Sveinung Fjaer (University of Bergen) for his assistance during our "heavy test-runs" and his patience in bringing the computers back. <rs corresp="#PMC4215532-software-102" type="publisher" subtype="person">Max Kuhn</rs> (Pfizer Inc.), author and maintainer of the <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC4215532-software-102">'caret' R package</rs>, is also acknowledged for his input during the code preparation.</p>

            <p>Our approach to the statistical data analysis could be named "harmonizing statistical evidences and predictions." It is rather fruitful because it combines not only confidence interval estimates for parameters, for the standardized effect size d C , for the achieved power (1-&#946;), and planned sample sizes, but prediction intervals for them and for pvalues, as well as estimates of posterior probabilities for the null hypothesis P(H 0 &#9474; D) and Bayes factors BF 10 . For parameter estimation and hypothesis testing the complementary combination of f requentist (orthodox) and Bayesian approaches was used. Nonparametric bootstrapping and permutation (Monte Carlo) procedures were realized with the number of replicates and/or random permutations as large as possible (but no less than 1 million). For measurable variables (stone size and density) medians and their 95% confidence limits were calculated.

            <p>We surveyed the literature in three steps. The sample was constructed between December 2010 and November 2011. First, the <rs type="software">Google Scholar</rs> and EconLIT search engines were used, searching for the key phrases "labor supply child care elasticity" and "labor force participation and child care prices" as well as variations of these key phrases that replace "labor supply" with "employment" and child care with "child care" throughout the construction period. The second source of literature was the reference lists of the articles found in the initial search. Third, the literature review of <ref type="bibr">Blau and Currie (2006)</ref> and the literature review of <ref type="bibr">Wrohlich (2006)</ref> were extensively used, the former for mostly studies from the United States and Canada, and the latter for studies from Europe. Forty-four estimates are included in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> for analysis from around 36 English language articles published between 1988 and 2010. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The studies estimating only the hours elasticity such as <ref type="bibr">Heckman (1974)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Averett et al.

            <p>According to <rs type="software">Google Scholar</rs>, <ref type="bibr">Jensen (2003)</ref> is the most cited empirical study on the relationship between FDI and democracy. It has been cited 650 times, and, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, it remains a key reference today. In this section, we investigate the robustness of this study's findings to outliers. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The sample covers 112 countries over the period 1970-1997, the dependent variable is FDI inflows as a share of GDP, and the proxy for democracy is Polity IV score (see Table <ref type="table">5</ref> for a description). We focus on the key regression of the paper: model 10 in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. The estimates suggest that a fully autocratic government (score of 0) becoming fully democratic (score of 20) can be expected to attract 0.4% more FDI flows as a percentage of GDP). Given that the average level of FDI flows in the sample is 1.3% of GDP, this is a sizeable amount.</p>

' A total of 40 cases were identified between 2010 and 2015. The complete text of the judgment documents was obtained after filing an application with the Supreme Court of Korea, and raw data were obtained from the lower courts. Cases were divided into facial surgeries and body surgeries and were further subdivided into additional categories. Each case was then analyzed to determine the number of individuals that were accused and the institution where the surgery had been performed. Additionally, the associated complications, monetary amounts, and reasons for judgments against plastic surgeons were analyzed. The cases were further evaluated with respect to care standards to determine whether a breach of care standards had occurred.</p>

            <p>After exposure, biofilms were dispersed in an ultrasonic bath (130 W, Branson 2510, Emerson Technologies GmbH &amp; Co. OHG, Dietzenbach, Germany) for 20 min. The antimicrobial effect was determined as the difference in the number of CFU in the suspension as described before <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>. The CFU of the treated sample (vs) were compared with the mean of the non-treated control sample (mc) of each test run. The reduction factor (RF) was defined by the formula: RF=log 10 (mc)-log 10 (vs) The standard deviations (&#177;) and p values (&#945;=0.05) were calculated based on the RFs in log 10 (CFU). Statistical differences were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by the Dunn's Multiple Comparison Test (<rs type="software" xml:id="PMC4184041-software-100">Prism</rs>, <rs type="publisher" corresp="#PMC4184041-software-100">GraphPad</rs>, USA).</p>

A Brownlee SPP C18 column (2.1 mm&#215;75 mm i.d., 2.7 mm) was used, and the mobile phase was 5% acetonitrile in H2O acidified with 0.1% acetic acid run at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The KJ was dissolved in 5% acetonitrile to a final concentration of 30 mg/mL, filtered using a 0.45-mm PVDF filter, and then injected at a volume of 30 mL. The operating parameters of the mass spectrometer were as follows. In the negative ion mode, source and desolvation temperatures were 120 and 350&#176;C, respectively; capillary voltage was 3000 V; cone voltage was 47 V; and collision energy was 30, 50 V. Nitrogen gas was used as the nebulizing and desolvation agents with flow rates of 50 and 350 L/h, respectively. The mass scan was set from m/z 100-800.

            <p>Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>. A model for FAK in invadopodia regulation. FAK and its phosphorylation at Tyr-397 recruit a pool of active Src to mediate localized tyrosine phosphorylation of substrates at focal adhesions. A balance between tyrosine phosphorylation at focal adhesions and invadopodia is required for proper dynamics and cell migration. Depletion of FAK releases active Src to mediate enhanced phosphorylation of substrates at invadopodia, which impairs focal adhesion dynamics but enhances the formation and dynamics of invadopodia; however, this is not sufficient for effective invasion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Artym et al., 2006)</ref> and subsequently coating with 10 &#181;g/ml fibronectin for 1 h at 37&#176;C. Matrigel (BD) coverslips were prepared by coating a thin layer of a 1:10 dilution of Matrigel for 1 h at 37&#176;C. Cells were cultured on coverslips for 16 h, fixed, and stained with antibodies. Coverslips were imaged using a 60&#215;/1.40 oil objective on an inverted microscope (1X-70; Olympus) equipped with a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (CoolSNAP FX; Photometrics) or an inverted microscope (TE300; Nikon) equipped with a cooled CCD camera (Orca II; Hamamatsu Photonics).

At least 40 cells were counted in each of at least three separate experiments performed on separate days. Dotlike structures containing cortactin and/or actin were scored as invadopodia. For ratiometric analysis, images were first subjected to high-pass filtration based on the water algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Zamir et al., 1999)</ref> to remove diffuse background fluorescence. The images were thresholded based on the vinculin image because it had the largest signal to noise ratio, providing the clearest distinction between focal adhesions and background. The thresholded vinculin image was used to generate a binary image in which values at focal adhesions equal 1 and all other values equal 0. A ratio image of vinculin/pY416 Src was generated, and high frequency noise was removed with a low-pass filter. Ratio images were displayed with similar nucleocytoplasmic background as a control for possible differences in staining. Ratiometric images presented are representative of at least 50 cells visualized by immunofluorescence.</p>

            <p>The primary analysis for the primary as well as secondary outcome measures was carried out by treatment allocated. Positive change scores indicate a benefit to parenting or well-being. A per protocol analysis compared outcomes for families in which parents did not attend an FLNP session to outcomes for families in which parents attended six or more FLNP sessions. For both treatment allocated and per protocol analysis, we report complete cases analysis results for all outcomes. In all analyses, we fitted multilevel models with a random effects term for course and for outcomes corresponding to individual child data and a random effects term for family. For the families in the control, the betweenfamily variance was assumed to be equal to that between families in the intervention group attending different courses; terms in the model were thus included as if each control family formed their own course, so that they contributed to estimating the between course random effect variance. For sensitivity analysis, we performed multiple imputation using predictive mean matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">70</ref> and results are reported for the primary  For each outcome, we created 10 imputed datasets using the <rs type="software">Hmisc package</rs> in the R statistical programme and combined the analysis results from the 10 imputed datasets using Rubin rules. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">70</ref> </p>

            <p>Infarct volume after MCAO was determined by 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma, Santa Clara, CA) at 24 h after MCAO. Animals were euthanized, and the brains were quickly collected. Brain tissue was sliced into seven coronal sections (2-mm thick) and stained with a 2% solution of TTC at 37&#176;C for 20 min, followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. TTC stains normal tissue red, but the infarct area remains a pale gray color. TTC-stained sections were photographed, and <rs type="software">Image-J</rs> image-processing software was used to calculate the infarct volume. The ratio of infarct volume = infarct area of the ipsilateral hemisphere/total area of the ipsilateral hemisphere &#215; 100% <ref type="bibr">22</ref> .</p>

Briefly, the background was digitally subtracted from the image using the macro provided, and then the lanes were manually designated with identically sized rectangles adequate to fully enclose the Huntingtin band in each lane. The 1D lane profile plots were generated by the software (representing the density of the image summed over horizontal raster lines of each rectangle), then the area under each lane's plot at the peak corresponding to the Huntingtin band was computed. These values were normalized by dividing by the value for the density of the tubulin band in the same lane obtained by the same method.</p>

This is because the amount of active RSK1 is only a fraction of the total RSK1 and its translocation to the nucleus creates a higher concentration in the nucleus than the larger cytoplasmic compartment. Because of this concentration difference, it is difficult to clearly see the cytoplasmic active RSK1 by immunocytochemistry with anti-phospho-T573 antibody. However, by cell fractionation (see Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>C later in this paper) and <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> analyses (see Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> later in this paper), active endogenous RSK1 is detectable in the cytoplasm.</p>

            <p>We have previously described the presence of CTB-EVs in our MSC EV preparation. These EVs were shown by pulse-chase experiments to be derived from endosomes and were therefore bona fide exosomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. In addition, CTB could be used to extract endosome-derived MSC EVs from an MSC-conditioned medium. These CTB-EVs carried exosome-associated proteins and had a flotation density of 1.09&#193;1.17 g/mL. In our extraction protocol, CTB effectively extracts at least 96% of CD81 in the conditioned medium <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Here, we determine the proteome of these CTB-EVs and CTB-EV depleted MSC EV preparation by mass spectrometry as previously described (10). 1,806 proteins were detected in the CTB-bound fraction and 1,547 were present in the CTB-depleted fraction (Supplementary File 1). 987 proteins were found in both fractions, suggesting that these 987 proteins are likely proteins commonly found in most EVs. The observation that 819 and 560 proteins were detected only in either CTB-bound or -depleted fraction respectively indicated that CTB-EVs represent a distinct class of EVs and that there were possibly other EV types beside the CTB-bound EVs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>). The proteins in the CTB-bound fraction and CTB-depleted fraction were functionally clustered into biological process, molecular functions and pathways by the <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC4770866-software-100">Ingenuity Pathway Analysis</rs> platform (<rs type="publisher" corresp="#PMC4770866-software-100">Ingenuity Systems</rs>, Mountain View, CA). From the analysis of the CTB-bound fraction and CTB-depleted fraction, we respectively selected a set of 20 pathways that had the least likelihood of the clustered proteins being associated with a pathway due to random chance, that is, the lowest p value. There were many shared pathways in these 2 sets. There were also pathways that were unique to either the CTB-bound or depleted fractions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</p>
            <p>The MSC EV preparation described above was extracted with CTB to isolate the CTB-binding EVs as described below. The remaining EV preparation after CTB extraction was collected as CTB-depleted MSC EV. Proteins (250 mg) from each of the 2 fractions were analysed by LC-MS/MS. Briefly, the samples were reduced by DTT, alkylated with IAA, digested by trypsin and analysed with LC-MS/MS as described <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. For each sample, all MS/MS spectra of each of the 3 independent preparations were extracted by <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC4770866-software-101">ProteomeDiscovere</rs> <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC4770866-software-101">1.4</rs> (<rs type="publisher" corresp="#PMC4770866-software-101">Thermo Scientific</rs>, Bremen, Germany) and combined into a single mascot generic file by a hand-written program. Protein identification was achieved by searching the combined data against the Uniprot human protein database (download 22 Jan 2014; 88479 sequences, 35079223 residues) via an in-house <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC4770866-software-102">Mascot</rs> server (Version <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC4770866-software-102">2.4.1</rs> <rs type="publisher" corresp="#PMC4770866-software-102">Matrix Science</rs>, UK). The search parameters were a maximum of 2 missed cleavages using trypsin; fixed modification was carbamidomethylation of cysteine, and variable modifications were oxidation of methionine and deamidation of asparagine and glutamine. The mass tolerances were set to 10 ppm and 0.8 Da for peptide precursor and fragment ions, respectively. Protein identification was accepted as true positive if 2 different peptides were found to have scores greater than the homology or identity scores.</p>

            <p>Vendors of standards have been known to use this to their advantage: Microsoft's breakthrough famously came with agreements to couple their software with IBM hardware. Another well-known case linked to the company is the bundling of its operating system Windows with its web browser <rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs>. Today, many large companies in the ICT (information and communication technology) sector maintain extensive portfolios of partly bundled or integrated products. While the phenomenon is by no means limited to the ICT sector, the strength of network externalities in ICT makes examples in this sector both more numerous and more obvious. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Obvious strategies to gain an advantage for a competing standard in such a setting include increasing the compatibility with major competitors in other segments, <ref type="bibr">3</ref> introducing spin-off standards in other segments, and reducing compatibility with weaker competitor's products in order to drive them out of business.</p>

            <p>All microscale thermophoresis measurements were performed at room temperature using Monolith NT TM Hydrophobic Capillaries and the Monolith NT.015T device by NanoTemper technologies with the laser being on for 40 s resulting in a temperature increase of 6 K (27). Binding reactions took place in a solution containing 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.05% (v/v) NP-40 and 5 mM MgCl 2 in final concentration, as well as one type of double-stranded, fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide as template (rDNA En: 5 0 -TCT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTC TTT TTT CCT CC, Cy5-labeled; GC ctrl: 5 0 -CAC GCG CTC GCG CAC GCG CTC GCG CAC GCG CTC, Cy3-labeled) with a constant concentration of 50 nM. For each binding analysis, a titration series was prepared with varying concentrations of the respective peptide as indicated in the plots. All curves were plotted with the <rs type="software">KaleidaGraph</rs> software, and the thermophoresis signals were fitted with the Hill equation corrected for the minimum (Min) and maximum (Max) values of the binding curve: Y(c) = Min+(Max &#192; Min)/(1+EC 50 / c 0 pep ) n , with Y (c) being the thermophoresis signal, c 0 pep the variable concentration of the respective peptide, EC 50 the concentration where half of the oligonucleotide is bound and n being the Hill-coefficient. Thermophoresis signals were normalized to fraction bound (X) by X = [Y(c) &#192; Min]/(Max &#192; Min), error bars (std) were normalized by std norm = std(c)/(Max &#192; Min), and both were plotted and fitted as described earlier in the text. K D values were not determined, as the gel retardation experiments showed that multiple protein-DNA complexes appear at higher peptide concentrations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3B</ref>).</p>

To simulate the subject's data, the NAFX peak was set to -2&#176; and the breadth of the NAFX vs Gaze Angle curve was set to be moderate and symmetrical. To simulate the effects of acetazolamide, it was hypothesized to act centrally by reducing the oscillation, originating in the damping control of smooth pursuit, which underlies most INS waveforms.</p>

            <p>Crosslinking to other operon databases. The DOOR system also provides links to other databases, currently two databases ODB and MicrobesOnline for each of its operons. The reason for linking to these databases is that ODB provides the most comprehensive literature information for operons and MicrobesOnline is the second largest operon database on the Internet. We expect that the crosslinks to other databases will grow as the needs arise and as new-related databases emerge.</p>
            <p>Generating easy-to-read text files for specified operons and associated information. The DOOR system can generate a file containing user-specified operons and associated information in a plain text format and output it to the users' local computer to facilitate large-scale applications by users.</p>
            <p>The DOOR system allows a user to predict cis-regulatory motifs for a given set of similar operons. For a set of operons identified to be similar, the system can retrieve the corresponding promoter sequence of each operon, and then it applies either <rs type="software">MEME</rs> <ref type="bibr">(9)</ref> or <rs type="software">CUBIC</rs> <ref type="bibr">(10)</ref>, selected by the user, to find conserved sequence motifs across the promoter sequences and predict them to be cis-regulatory motifs.</p>
            <p>Given two operons O 1 and O 2 , with O 1 having m genes and O 2 having n genes. For each pair of genes between O 1 and O 2 , we call them homologous genes if their sequence similarity, measured by <rs type="software">BLAST</rs>, is above a preselected cutoff. We then create a bipartite graph G, in which genes in O 1 and O 2 are represented as vertices and for each pair of homologous genes defined above, we create an edge between the two genes and use their sequence similarity as their weight in the graph G. The weight of the maximum weighted bipartite matching (8) for graph G is defined as the similarity score between operons O 1 and O 2 . In the current implementation, DOOR uses the &#192;logarithm of <rs type="software">BLAST</rs> E-values or alignment bit-scores to measure the level of similarity between two operons. Please find a detailed explanation in the Supplementary Material.</p>
            <p>The DOOR system supports a wiki page (OperonWiki) to facilitate interactions between the user and the developers of the database. Our goal is to have a comprehensive set of operons for all sequenced prokaryotic genomes, which will require substantial manual curations in order to keep our operon data as accurate as possible. Our plan is that we will rely not only on our development team but also on the user community of the database to do this. We have developed a Wiki for the DOOR system to collect users' feedbacks about our operon data and make necessary changes on the database when such suggestions are made by users after our validation.</p>
            <p>A user can go to the main page of DOOR, click on 'Operon Search' and then specify the query criterion 'Operon ID = 4015' to find this operon if the user knows its ID. Otherwise, the user can find this operon by using other information. For example, he/she can search for the operon by finding its component genes through the 'Gene Search' page by using the query criteria '(Gene Include ssu) AND (Species Name Include MG1655)'. On the query result page, click the link containing operon ID ('4015') to get to the detailed target operon page. The user can see that this operon has 1476 similar operons. By clicking on the link '1476' on the 'Similar Operon' row, the user can see the list of all its similar operons. In order to apply the prediction tool for cis-regulatory motifs, the user needs to select a number of similar operons to the query operon by checking the checkbox on relevant operon rows, and then click the button 'Add Selected Operons', which adds all the selected operons to the working environment. To see which operons have been added to the working environment, the user can click the button 'Selected Operons' on the main menu. Then check the checkboxes for the interested operons and click the button 'Show Upstream Regions' to get and show the promoter regions of the selected operons. The user can now proceed to predict cis-regulatory motifs by either clicking on 'Do <rs type="software">MEME</rs>' (or 'Do <rs type="software">CUBIC</rs>'), which invokes the <rs type="software">MEME</rs> with the selected promoter sequences. In this case, the program returns the following table <ref type="table">(Table</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) for operon ID = 4015.</p>
            <p>For this particular example, we have checked which transcription factors can bind to the promoter sequences in the RegulonDB database. We found that six transcriptional factors can bind to the promoter region of the ssuEABCD operon, and the binding sites for four of them have been identified experimentally. Two of them are identified here by running <rs type="software">MEME</rs>. We believe that the reason for failing to identify the other two motifs is due to the small number of promoter sequences that we used in this example.</p>
            <p>Searching for operons. A user can search for interested operons in DOOR by multiple ways.</p>

            <p>The benchmark tree comes from the work of Foster et al., in which they first created all pairwise wholegenome alignments using <rs type="software">MUMmer</rs> and then grouped the SNPs by shared locations to compare across all taxa. Foster et al. <ref type="bibr">(21)</ref> next analyzed the SNPs multiple alignment using the best substitution model as selected by <rs type="software">ModelTest</rs>, and finally constructed a phylogenetic tree using the NJ method and verified the tree using different methods.</p>
            <p>The benchmark p-distances were generated by an <rs type="software">in-house Perl script</rs>, using the web file 40 way Escherichia/Shigella genomes alignment (http://www .biotorrents.net/details.php?id=87), which includes all the Escherichia/Shigella 26 genomes.

            <p>TAP-tagged samples were eluted from IgG Sepharose with TEV cleavage and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Two experimental and two control samples (mock purification from a Tetrahymena cell line not expressing TAP-Pot1a) were separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and visualized by colloidal Coomassie. The entire lane was excised, divided into 16 pieces, and prepared for MS analysis by in-gel reduction, alkylation, and trypsin digestion. The eluted samples were then analyzed by reverse-phase nano-electrospray tandem MS as described previously <ref type="bibr">(Mead et al., 2010)</ref>. The MS/MS spectra emanating from the gel slices for each lane were concatenated and searched against tryptic peptides predicted from the Tetrahymena genome (TTA1_08302006.pep; ftp://ftp.ciliate.org/Tetrahymena/sequence/) using the <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC3204076-software-100">X!Tandem</rs> (<rs type="url" corresp="#PMC3204076-software-100">www.thegpm.org/TANDEM</rs>) and <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC3204076-software-101">Mascot</rs> (<rs type="publisher" corresp="#PMC3204076-software-101">Matrix Science</rs>, Boston, MA) search engines.

Furthermore, the behavior of online workers has been shown to be comparable to those of subjects in laboratory studies <ref type="bibr">(Paolacci, Chandler, and Ipeirotis 2010; Buhrmester, Kwang, and Gosling 2011; Horton, Rand, and Zeckhauser 2011; Suri et al. 2011)</ref>.</p>
            <p>A total of 1475 subjects participated in the experiment, which translates into approximately 200 subjects per treatment.

Our hourly wage is comparable to that of other surveys conducted on <rs type="software">Mturk</rs> (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Kuziemko et al. 2015 paid $6</ref>.00 per hour), and much higher than the estimated reservation wage of <rs type="software">Mturk</rs> workers; $1.38 <ref type="bibr">(Horton and Chilton 2010)</ref>.</p>

Each subject is asked to roll a virtual die and report the outcome of the die roll either by completing a self-report or confirmation report. We find strong evidence of lying in both treatments. We also find that the effect of confirmation report is heterogenous across prefilled number, gender, and roller status. Overall, we find that people are more likely to confirm the truth than to self-report the truth, and more likely to confirm a lie than to tell a lie.

The survey and overview of the results are available with the online appendix. The results show that, similar to the objective data, controlling for a country's income, respondents from volunteer collection countries are more likely to believe their country is collecting blood effi ciently and distributing it fairly (p &lt; .05).

The sxy point mutations are predicted to cause 2-to 3-fold increases in single-strandedness.</p>

            <p>As a web-based system, <rs type="software">pseudoMap</rs> can thoroughly identify TPGs, including TPGs act as a miRNA regulators and TPGs-derived eSTIs in humans. There are two ways to access <rs type="software">pseudoMap</rs>: by browsing the database content or by searching for a particular TPG. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>A displays theIt displays the more fine-grained information of (E) esiRNA-target interaction and (F) RNA folding structure of TPG-derived esiRNA. In addition, <rs type="software">pseudoMap</rs> also incorporates the external sources, such as (G) UCSC genome browser for a genomic view, GeneCards for gene annotation and miRBase for miRNA annotation.</p>
            <p>A computational pipeline was developed to verify the hypotheses that human TPGs may generate esiRNAs to regulate protein-coding genes (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). An attempt was made to identify the candidates of TPG-derived esiRNAs, by aligning the sequences of TPGs and fsRNAs. These candidates were verified using the deep sequencing data from various sRNA libraries <ref type="bibr">(35-38)</ref> experimented with on human embryo stem cells, liver tissues or HCC tissues. The hairpin structure by <rs type="software">Mfold</rs> <ref type="bibr">(40)</ref> was then determined by using the extended sequences of these candidates of esiRNAs. In <rs type="software">pseudoMap</rs>, a total of 1232 TPGs may produce esiRNAs, which were profiling by deep sequencing data, within 1404 human TPGs were characterized. The information of these TPGs is shown in Supplementary File 1. The results showed that 4 miRNAs and 326 piRNAs may derive from TPGs. We also found that miRNA has-miR-622 was identified, which was derived from keratin 18 pseudogene 27, located on nt 858-879, as similar as miRBase database. Table <ref type="table">2</ref> summarizes the entire statistical analysis of <rs type="software">pseudoMap</rs>.</p>
            <p>Our previous approach (41) was modified to identify TPG-derived esiRNA targets. Briefly, the esiRNA targetsites within the conserved regions of coding, 5'-UTR and 3'-UTR of genes were identified in 12 metazoan genomes by using three computational approaches, <rs type="software">TargetScan</rs> <ref type="bibr">(42- 44)</ref>, <rs type="software">miRanda</rs> <ref type="bibr">(45)</ref> and <rs type="software">RNAhybrid</rs> <ref type="bibr">(46)</ref>. The minima free energy (MFE) threshold was &#192;20 kcal/mol with a score more than or equal to 150 for <rs type="software">miRanda</rs> and default parameters for <rs type="software">TargetScan</rs> and <rs type="software">RNAhybrid</rs>. The targets were identified using the following criteria: (i) the potential target sites were determined by at least two approaches; (ii) multiple target sites were prioritized and (iii) target sites must be located in accessible regions. Finally, we provided the gene expression profiles of TPG and its cognate gene to construct the eSTIs.</p>
            <p>The system flow of <rs type="software">pseudoMap</rs> is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, mainly including the collection of datasets such as TPGs, parental</p>
            <p>To demonstrate that in human, as in animal models, TPGs may generate naturally occurring siRNAs and Piwi interacting RNAs (piRNAs) to regulate the expression of protein-coding genes, we have developed a computational pipeline and constructed a database-pseudoMap, the map for studying pseudogenes. <rs type="software">pseudoMap</rs> pre-processes the raw data of public microarray and deep sequencing data into gene expression profiles for both TPG and its cognate gene and small RNA (sRNA) profiles for TPG-derived esiRNAs. <rs type="software">pseudoMap</rs> further combined the gene expression profiles to construct the TPG-derived esiRNA-target interactions (eSTIs). In addition, according to the previous study of pseudogene, PTENP1 exerts a miRNA decoy by binding to cognate-targeting miRNAs <ref type="bibr">(17)</ref>, and <rs type="software">pseudoMap</rs> also provided the 'miRNA regulator' to elucidate the relationship of TPG and its cognate gene with miRNA target regulation.</p>

It should be noted that the design criterion for both the detection probe and capture probe affinities was a melting temperature 108C above the desired reaction temperature. The optimal TP stem strength was designed to have a melting temperature 308C above the reaction temperature. In practice, in order to achieve specificity, we had to increase the reaction temperature such that the predicted melting temperatures for the detection and capture probes were 58C below the reaction temperature, whereas the predicted stem melting temperature was only 158C above the reaction temperature.</p>

Therefore the latter value was used for all remaining tests. Finally, F pen was fit to the fluorescent curves of three different dilutions of target mixed with TPs using the original equation. All parameters necessary for calculations are summarized in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.</p>

            <p>Over a period of 4 years leading up to <rs type="software">Mobyle</rs>'s first release, a series of about 30 user interviews and participatory design workshops involving brainstorming sessions and video prototyping were conducted. These were used to gain a deeper understanding of how a web portal could facilitate the use of bioinformatics tools by biologists. These studies are described in detail elsewhere <ref type="bibr">(Letondal and Amanatian, 2004)</ref>. The results showed the principal needs of biologists to be: (1) a stable and predictable set of known tools integrated in a portal designed for inexperienced users; (2) an overview of the analyses and careful organization of results; (3) reusability features to re-execute previous commands; and (4) userdefined and ready-to-use analysis pipelines, similar to benchmarked protocols. We also concluded that caution should be taken regarding advanced features. Indeed, (5) biologists are often sceptical about sophisticated tools that are difficult to understand: they have to be able to anticipate the benefits that such tools may provide.</p>

These no-trade-off heuristics include lexicographic models, conjunctive rules, disjunctive rules, and elimination-by-aspects (see also <ref type="bibr">Lilly 1994)</ref>.

            <p>In the case of Pfam and Rfam, there is a logical marriage with Wikipedia that stores the annotations for the families. All the other family data, such as multiple sequence alignments are stored in a local <rs type="software">MySQL</rs> database. As well as the relational data model, wikis also do not lend themselves to storing data entities such as alignments, structures and probabilistic models. Most databases have extensive quality control procedures, which do not fit the simple edit and save model of the wiki. Consequently, other mechanisms are required to add new entries to the database [for an example from Pfam, see ref. <ref type="bibr">(7)</ref>], but wikis, in whatever form, provide an excellent platform for storing free text annotations that are editable by a distributed user community.</p>

            <p>Along with potential TSPs for antisense transcription our screen revealed a large number of intragenic promoters with sense orientation and preferred location near the initiating codon. Though expediency of alternative transcription remains vague, very similar phenomenon has been recently registered in eukaryotic genomes [see, e.g. ref. <ref type="bibr">(40)</ref>]. In the chromosome of E. coli, there are several pairs of extensively overlapping genes encoding two proteins or a protein and an untranslated RNA. Many of them may be transcribed from common promoters. However genes hokC, tpr and ygeN with 5 0 -ends mapped within mokC, rttR and ygeO, respectively, as well as 46 transcripts partly matching sense strand and detected in the fraction of short RNAs by Vogel et al. <ref type="bibr">(31)</ref> may be also initiated from their own promoters predicted by <rs type="software">PlatProm</rs>. Internal promoters with sense orientation may, thus, mark candidates for alternative transcription.</p>

For identification of Sal1 sequences in wheat, annotated Arabidopsis Sal1 (TAIR accession 4010745380) sequences were screened against publicly available wheat expressed sequence tag sequences (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/wEST/) which were then assembled into one contig using CAP3 at a stringency level of 95% similarity over a 20-bp overlap <ref type="bibr">(Huang and Madan, 1999)</ref>. The assembled sequences were validated by PCR amplification of wheat cDNA followed by sequencing, resulting in a 1077-bp region.

The kappa statistic was used to measure the inter-rater agreement between the two independent raters for the ratings of each item and for the overall rating. <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref> <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC4621286-software-100">Review Manager (RevMan</rs> <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC4621286-software-100">5.3</rs>) was used to estimate pooled the mean difference (MD) when the same continuous measure was used as the outcome measure in all included studies, the standard mean difference (SMD) when different continuous measures were used as outcome measures in included studies, and risk ratios (RR) for outcomes that were categorical measures.</p>
            <p>&#8226;Systematic review and meta-analysis&#8226; Background: The efficacy and safety of the combined treatment of refractory schizophrenia with antipsychotic medications and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remain uncertain. Aim: Conduct systematic review and meta-analysis of available literature in English and Chinese about ECT in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia. Methods: English and Chinese databases were searched for studies published prior to May 20, 2015 regarding the efficacy and safety of the combined treatment of refractory schizophrenia with antipsychotic medications and ECT. Two researchers selected and evaluated studies independently using pre-defined criteria. <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC4621286-software-101">Review Manager</rs> <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC4621286-software-101">5.3</rs> software was used for data analysis. Results: A total of 22 randomized control studies, 18 of which were conducted in mainland China, were included in the analysis. Meta-analysis of data from 18 of the 22 studies with a pooled sample of 1394 individuals found that compared to treatment with antipsychotic medications alone, combined treatment with antipsychotic medications and ECT had significantly higher rates of achieving study-specific criteria of 'clinical improvement' (RR=1.25, 95%CI=1.14-1.37). Based on the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria, the quality of evidence for this assessment of efficacy was 'moderate'. However, the proportion of participants who experienced headache during the treatment was significantly higher in the combined treatment group (RR=9.10, 95%CI=3.97-20.86, based on a pooled sample of 517 from 8 studies) and the proportion who experienced memory impairment was also higher in the combined treatment group (RR=6.48, 95%CI=3.54-11.87, based on a pooled sample of 577 from 7 studies). The quality of evidence about these adverse events was rated as 'very low'. Conclusions: There are very few high quality randomized controlled clinical trials about the combination of antipsychotic medications and ECT in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia. This meta-analysis found that the combination of antipsychotic medications and ECT could improve psychiatric symptoms in patients with refractory schizophrenia, but the incomplete methodological information provided for most of the studies, publication bias (favoring studies with better outcomes in the combined treatment group), and the low quality of evidence about adverse outcomes, cognitive impairment, and overall functioning raise questions about the validity of the results.</p>
            <p>We also evaluated the quality and level of evidence of each outcome variable for each of the 22 included studies using the <rs type="publisher" corresp="#PMC4621286-software-102">Cochrane collaboration</rs>'s <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC4621286-software-102">Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE)</rs> software. This software assesses limitations of the design, consistency of results, indirect evidence, precision of results, publication bias, and effect size for each outcome. <ref type="bibr">[5,6]</ref> The overall level of evidence is rated as 'high', 'medium', 'low', or 'very low'.</p>

When the two authors disagreed about the inclusion of an article and were unable to agree after discussing the article, a third author (LCB) made the final determination.

For each subject, fMRI responses were modeled using a canonical hemodynamic response function and the general linear model was used to perform a first level, within-participants analysis on the functional data from each subject individually for the primary contrasts (happy minus neutral and fearful minus neutral faces), with spatial realignment parameters entered as covariates.</p>
            <p>Task protocol. Participants completed a task of implicit facial emotion processing comprising eight blocks of happy faces, eight blocks of fearful faces, eight blocks of neutral faces and eight blocks of fixation crosses. Facial stimuli were from an established battery of emotional faces, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> and comprised eight different facial identities expressing happy, fearful and neutral expressions (that is, 24 faces in total). Stimuli were presented in a blocked design in one of two pseudorandom orders (which were counterbalanced across all participants in each study group) and were presented in <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC3309518-software-101">e-Prime</rs> version <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC3309518-software-101">2.0 Professional</rs> (<rs type="publisher" corresp="#PMC3309518-software-101">Psychological Software Tools</rs>, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Each block lasted 20 s and comprised four stimuli presented for 4 s each with an interstimulus interval of 1 s. Blocks were separated by a 2 s interblock interval. During task conditions (happy, fearful and neutral faces) participants were required to press one of two buttons to indicate the gender of the face using a button box held in the right hand. During fixation blocks, the participants were required to stare passively at a fixation cross. As with the facial blocks, four fixation cross stimuli were presented for 4 s each with an interstimulus interval of 1 s.</p>

            <p>Previous work has demonstrated that the PER2 S662G and PER2 S662D mutations give rise to completely contrary circadian phenotypes in terms of circadian period, phase and amplitude; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> thus, we predicted Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> The relative phases of cell cycle genes are shifted by PER2 mutations. Wild-type and different PER2 mutant MEFs were synchronized by a dexamethasone treatment, and RNA was extracted at 3 h intervals stating 10 h after the shock. p21, Cyclin D1 and Nr1d1 expression analysis were done by q-PCR. Experiments were repeated independently at least three times with consistent results. Plotted values are the mean values &#177; S.D. Cosinor analysis was performed on mRNA profiles using SPSS 17.0. The amplitude and acrophase obtained from cosinor analysis were further analyzed by Students t-test. The null hypothesis was rejected at Po0.05 that the PER2 S662G and PER2 S662D mutant mice should have contrary cancer risks if impaired rhythm is the culprit. However, the enhanced cancer risk in both PER2 S662G2H :p53 R172H/ &#254; and PER2 S662D2H :p53 R172H/ &#254; mice strongly suggested that the impaired PER2 gene, not the impaired circadian rhythm, is responsible for the increased cancer risk in these mice. This observation is further supported by survival data from the PER2 S662D2H :p53 R172H/ &#254; and Clock D19/ &#254; :p53 R172H/ &#254; mice, both of which exhibited lengthened circadian periods, but showed highly contrary cancer risks. Interestingly, the 'impaired gene' theory is consistent with the observation from cancer risks in Cry1 &#192;/&#192; :Cry2 &#192;/&#192; mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> and Clock D19 mutant mice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> In addition, we wish to point out that our experiments share an important similarity with the abovementioned investigations; all of these experimental systems retain the circadian mutant mice on normal light/dark cycles and subject these mice to entrainment from external time cues. Accordingly, the 'impaired gene' theory may only apply to circadian mutant mice kept in normal light/dark cycles. Circadian disruption is not as intense or detrimental in normal cycles as the disruption experienced by shift workers. In this regard, an important future direction may focus on both the respective contribution and the composite consequence of disrupted circadian genes, as well as disrupted circadian rhythm to cancer risk in persistent phase-shifted schedules.</p>

            <p>Stanford ERAS protocol is a three-phase multimodal care pathway that includes pre-, intra-and post-operative steps, supported by published data <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> The protocol includes preoperative education, no bowel prep, 24 hour perioperative antibiotics with cefoxitin begun within 1 hour of incision, epidural postop analgesia with minimization of narcotics, careful fluid management, no nasogastric tube and early feeding. Alvimopan, a gastrointestinal opioid receptor antagonist, was introduced in the protocol in July 2013 and was used in the last 101 patients. Patients did not routinely go to the ICU and home intravenous hydration was not used. We excluded from the analysis 4 patients who remained intubated post-operatively and could not be started on oral feeding. Results were compared with a pre-ERAS consecutive series of 177 RC patients from the three years prior to institution of the ERAS protocol, January 2009 to December 2011. Data were analyzed with <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC5271433-software-100">SPSS</rs> &#174; , version <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC5271433-software-100">19.0</rs>. A logistic regression model was performed to identify independent variables associated with readmission.

The normality of data was checked and transformation was done for not normal data. Descriptive statistics, including mean and SD were calculated for continuous variables. The dependent variables were established cardiovascular risk factors, including lipid and lipoprotein concentrations, blood pressure, and CRP. One-way ANOVA was done to compare the mean of mentioned variables among different categorization of body fat composition. The relationships between body composition, anthropometric variables and risk factors were assessed using correlation coefficient. For HDL-c and FBS, non-parametric test was done. In order to evaluate the independence of correlates of risk factor variables, after adjusting for age and socioeconomic status of family, linear regression analysis was used, except for CRP, response of which was observed by exponential regression. Statistical significance level was considered as P less than 0.05.</p>

            <p>The TLICS consists of three variables: 1) the morphology of the fracture pattern as assessed by radiological tests, 2) whether injury in the posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) is involved or not, and 3) the neurologic status of the patient (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). After scoring each variable, the treatment plans are determined according to the sum (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). When scoring the variables of the TLICS, the morphology of injury, based on the radiology of the thoracolumbar injury, was classified as 3 types: 1) the compression type, 2) the translocation/rotation type and 3) the distraction type, and they were each scored as 1, 3 and 4 points, respectively. Additionally, concerning the presence of a burst fracture with the compression injuries, 1 point was added and thus it was scored as 2 points. For cases with multiple injuries of an identical type, no more than one injury was added to be scored. For cases with the combination of multiple different 110 / ASJ: Vol. 4, No. 2, 2010  types of injuries, only one injury type with the highest points was scored. Regarding the score of the injury in the posterior ligamentous complex, the cases with no other injury were 0 points, the cases with unclear injury were 2 points and the cases with apparent injury were scored as 3 points. As for the score of the neurologic status, the cases without neurological symptoms on the neurologic examination were 0 points, the cases with injury at the nerve root were 2 points and the cases with complete or incomplete neurological injury in the spinal cord and the conus medullaris were 2 points and 3 points, respectively. The cases with injury in the cauda equine were scored as 3 points (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 and 2</ref>). Afterward, the intrarater reliability, as well as the interrater reliability of the score for each variable and sum, were evaluated by Cohen's unweighted k-value and Spearman' s rank order correlation. For the statistical distinction of the Kappa values, the distinction according to the guideline of Viera and Garrett <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> was applied (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). In addition, the sensitivity and specificity were evaluated by the percent of correct treatment protocols according to the sum of the TLICS and the treatment actually performed on the patients. The validity of selecting treatment protocols according to this classification was also assessed. <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC2996622-software-100">SPSS</rs> ver. <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC2996622-software-100">13.0</rs> (SPSS Reliability and Validity of TLICS / 111 Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.

            <p>Background: Incidence of asthma in adolescents leads to variations in family status, roles and interaction with peers for them, which could be a source of stress and psychological tensions in them. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the effect of Orem's self-care model on perceived stress in adolescents with asthma. Methods: In this semi-experimental study conducted from April 2013 to February 2014, 64 asthmatic adolescents referring Shariati Hospital, Isfahan were enrolled by simple random sampling and the patients were assigned to two groups of control and intervention. Then, Orem's self-care model-based training was implemented throughout eight sessions of two hours each and the Cohen Perceived Stress Scale was administered to both groups prior to and two months after the completion of the training. The data were analyzed by descriptive and analytical statistics consisting of paired t-test, independent t-test, Chi-square and Mann-Whitney using <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC4926004-software-100">SPSS</rs> Version <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC4926004-software-100">20</rs>. Results: Mean age of the participants was 14.15&#177;3.12 years in the intervention group and 15.21&#177;3.09 years in the control groups. 68.8% and 59.4% of the participants were male in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Independent t-test indicated a significant difference in the mean scores of perceived stress in the intervention (25.46&#177;5.31) and control groups (28.90&#177;5.27) after the training. Also, the result of paired t-test indicated a significant difference in the mean score of perceived stress between before (29.18&#177;5.27) and after (25.46&#177;5.31) training.</p>

            <p>The SGRQ total score is a continuous variable, and was positively skewed with many zeros. Thus, the two-part model was developed, which takes advantage of the basic rule of probability and splits into two parts-frequency (ie, any worse respiratory health status and the estimate included all the participants) and severity (ie, amount of worse respiratory health status and the estimate was based on a subsample of participants with respiratory health status greater than zero). <ref type="bibr">19 20</ref> The two-part model used logit regression in the first part, and generalised linear model regression with the log link and &#947; distribution in the second part. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> Both the unadjusted and adjusted (to determine independent predictors of the score) models were developed, which also included a sample with unknown values for the variables (from section I). All the section I variables were included in the adjusted model. Coefficients and their respective 95% CI were calculated. The results were considered significant when p values were less than or equal to 0.05.

            <p>Although articles appearing in the journal are normally solicited by the editors and associate editors, a number of unsolicited proposals and papers arrive directly at the journal's administrative office. The journal charges no submission fee and thus attracts a wide range of proposals. Most submissions are inappropriate for the journal for one reason or another, often including level of specialization, style of exposition, or narrowness of focus. Others are good ideas that overlap to some extent with plans that have already been made. Still other suggestions offer possibilities and spark a discussion between the editors, the associate editors, and the author that sometimes leads to a JEP article. The journal typically receives roughly 200 unsolicited proposals each year. While the journal remains open to ideas and input from all sources, it remains the case that the overwhelming proportion of articles appearing in the journal are solicited by the editors and associate editors. During the past year, the journal has moved to electronic distribution of galley proofs and all materials, as well as using <rs type="software">Skype</rs> for international calls when possible.</p>

Varying the value of &#947; allows the researcher to assess the sensitivity of the results with respect to 'hidden bias'.

            <p>The time indicator (&#120575; &#119895;&#119905; ) from equation <ref type="formula">4</ref>) estimates market j's average price at time t, holding retailer effects constant. We use the estimated &#120575; &#119895;&#119905; as prices in the synthetic control group estimator. <ref type="bibr">46</ref> Abadie et al.'s  <rs type="software">Stata</rs> programs also require a balanced panel. Hence, for a given merger, we limit the potential set of controls to comparison markets that report prices for each period reported by the merger market.</p>
            <p>We use the  <rs type="software">Stata</rs> code developed by <ref type="bibr">Abadie et al. (2010)</ref> to estimate the synthetic control model. <ref type="bibr">45</ref> Abadie et al.'s program requires that there be a single time series for the treatment group being analyzed. Thus, we need to aggregate the data to the level of a market/quarter from a market/retailer/quarter. However, we cannot simply construct a simple average of the retailers' prices in a market, because not all retailers are observed in a market in every time period; that is, the composition of retailers observed in a market varies over time. Instead, we construct a price index that controls for retailer/market effects. Specifically, we regress retailer i's (log) price in market j at time t on a retailer/market fixed-effect (&#120572; &#119894;&#119895; ) and a series of time indicators. We estimate these regressions at the retailer/market level.</p>
            <p>Tables <ref type="table">1 and Appendix</ref> Table <ref type="table">4</ref> shows two major differences between the mergers we were able to examine and those that we excluded. First, overall, the excluded mergers took place in smaller markets. For instance, three of the 12 excluded mergers took place in very small markets (with fewer than 10 stores), and only one merger took place in a large market (Supervalu's purchases of the Jewel/Osco chain in Chicago). Second, in part because the excluded mergers took place in smaller markets, these markets tended to be more concentrated premerger. For example, Table <ref type="table">1</ref> shows that three of the studied mergers studied took place in unconcentrated markets (with an HHI &lt;1,500), while only one of the omitted mergers took place in an unconcentrated market. <ref type="bibr">31</ref> To provide the reader with a sense of how the mergers affected market concentration in the regions located close to the merging firms' stores, we have also calculated the level and change of the HHI in the region immediately surrounding each of the merging firms' stores (defined as a 6-mile circle centered at the location of a store owned by one of the two merging firms). By construction, this technique generates as many "local markets" as there are stores owned by the merging firms. The online Appendix Table <ref type="table">4</ref> presents descriptive statistics of the empirical distributions of the level and change in market concentration corresponding to each of the 14 studied mergers. Qualitatively, market concentration measured at the CBSA level and within the region immediately surrounding the affected stores were quite similar (with a correlation coefficient of 0.92). The level of market concentration (HHI) in the smaller regions tends to be larger than in the CBSA because (in most cases) fewer independent firms operate within subregions of a CBSA. <ref type="bibr">32</ref> Most studies that exploit geographic variation in how mergers affect pricing using an identification strategy similar to ours. Examples include studies of mergers in the airline industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Borenstein, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Kim &amp; Singal 1993)</ref>, banking <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Prager &amp; Hannan, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Focarelli &amp; Panetta, 2003)</ref>, gasoline refining and distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Taylor &amp; Hosken 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Simpson &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Taylor 2008), and</ref><ref type="bibr">hospitals (Haas-Wilson &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Garmon 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Tenn 2011</ref>). <ref type="bibr">33</ref> To our knowledge, the synthetic control estimator has not been used to estimate the price impact of mergers. <ref type="bibr">34</ref> We use the <rs type="software" xml:id="10.1111%2Fjems.12218-software-100">Stata code</rs> developed by <rs type="publisher" subtype="person" corresp="#10.1111%2Fjems.12218-software-100">Sergio Correia</rs> (reghdfe.ado) available at <rs type="url" corresp="#10.1111%2Fjems.12218-software-100">https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s457874.html</rs> (last visited September <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">23,</ref><ref type="bibr">2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">35</ref> For the larger mergers we have been able to identify the dates the transactions closed, for example, A&amp;P's merger with Pathmark. For smaller mergers, such as the transfer of ownership of a handful of stores in a small CBSA, we have not been able to identify the precise date the merger became effective. <ref type="bibr">36</ref> Two of the mergers (in Evansville and Topeka) were consummated in the first half of 2008. For these transactions, we assume the effects of the merger are felt within 6 months. That is, pricing observed in 2009 represents how prices changed as the result of the merger. model. <ref type="bibr">50</ref> The postmerger HHI is equal to the sum of the premerger HHI and the change in HHI shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. <ref type="bibr">51</ref> This can be more clearly seen in the figure in the appendix that plots the change in market concentration and the change in price (the analogue to Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). <ref type="bibr">52</ref> We have also examined the relationship between the postmerger level of concentration or change in concentration using alternative measures of market concentration, (e.g., market concentration measured within either 3 or 6 miles of a store owned by the merging firms). In all cases, we find qualitatively similar results to those shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>: both the level of postmerger concentration and the change in concentration are positively correlated with the change in postmerger prices. However, only the level of postmerger concentration is statistically related to postmerger prices (at either the 5 % or 10% significance level). The results from this analysis are shown in online Appendix Table <ref type="table">7</ref>. <ref type="bibr">53</ref> Antitrust economists have developed a number of techniques to measure the intensity of competition between competing retailers beyond market concentration to help identify which retailing mergers are most likely to be problematic (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Hosken &amp; Tenn [2016]</ref>for a recent survey). <ref type="bibr">54</ref> In related work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hosken, Olson, and Smith (2016)</ref> examine the efficacy of using market entry and exit studies to forecast the likely competitive impact of horizontal mergers. Implicitly, this methodological approach assumes that the price impact of entry (exit) is the reverse of (the same as) a horizontal merger. That is, the estimated reduction in market prices following entry would be roughly the same magnitude (but opposite in sign) as a horizontal merger of similar size. Hosken, Olson, and Smith evaluate this methodological approach by estimating the price impact of market entry and exit in the supermarket industry. They conclude that studies of market exit are unlikely to inform merger analysis (more often than not market exit is associated with reductions in market price). Their findings for entry studies are more promising. Although the authors find evidence that the price impact of entry is biased down (in absolute value), overall, significant market entry appears to lower market prices. Moreover, when the authors compare the estimated price impact of entry to the estimated price effects of mergers found in this study, they note that they are of a similar magnitude. For this reason, Hosken, Olson, and Smith conclude that well-executed entry studies can provide useful information to aid antitrust enforcers in identifying potentially anticompetitive mergers.</p>

            <p>Employment of the sys-GMM methodology portends a number of advantages in model estimation beyond providing a solution for simultaneity.

Although <rs type="software">xtabond2</rs> is mainly used for estimating dynamic models -that is, for which w in equation <ref type="formula">9</ref>) includes single or multiple lags of the dependent variable -it is flexible enough to be employed for static specifications as well <ref type="bibr">(Drukker, 2008)</ref>. We employ (less efficient) one-step estimation procedures since under (more efficient) two-step estimation (which applies an estimated optimal weighting matrix to the firststep estimates and which means the right-hand side varies slightly across equations), adding-up conditions fail to precisely hold. One-step and two-step procedures yield qualitatively similar results regarding the main questions of interest in this study.</p>

            <p>In practice, the within estimator is obtained by carrying out first a within transformation then calculating the least squares estimator on these centred variables. However, this has to be done carefully because, as transformed variables are being used, the standard estimator of the variance obtained with the ordinary least squares procedure does not correspond directly to the unbiased estimator of the variance of the within model. It underestimates it. A multiplying factor (CT -K) / (CT -C -K) needs to be taken into account, where C is the number of cohorts, T the number of observation dates and K the number of explanatory variables. In <rs type="software">SAS</rs>, the <rs type="software">Bwithin macro</rs> written by <ref type="bibr">Duguet (1999)</ref> takes this problem into account (for other <rs type="software">Stata</rs> and <rs type="software">R procedures</rs>, see <ref type="bibr">Guillerm, 2015)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Issues of implementation of statistical software are not addressed in the articles. Examples of <rs type="software">SAS</rs>, <rs type="software">R</rs> and <rs type="software">Stata</rs> programmes are provided in <ref type="bibr">Guillerm (2015)</ref>, on which the article is based.</p>
            <p>We then checked whether our results were dependant on our identification strategy. In particular, <ref type="bibr">Chauvel and Schroeder (2014)</ref>, who demonstrate that the baby boom generations had more disposable income than other generations and whose results differ from our own, use a different strategy based on <ref type="bibr">Chauvel (2013)</ref>. This is called the Age-Period-Cohort-Detrended (APCD) method and focuses on the fluctuations in the age, cohort and period effects around their respective linear trend. It cannot be used to compare cohorts with one another, only in relation to an unknown coefficient. We present this method in the C4 online supplement and we used the APCD module (available on <rs type="software">Stata</rs>) with our data in an attempt to reproduce their results.</p>

            <p>Imputation of stage data. To determine the likely stage distribution among women with missing data on stage in each registry, we conducted multiple imputation using chained equations with the ice command in <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC3619080-software-100">Stata</rs> <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC3619080-software-100">12</rs>, specifying an ordered logistic model <ref type="bibr">(Nur et al, 2010; White et al, 2011)</ref>. We imputed TNM stage I-IV and SEER SS2000. We first used logistic regression models to determine which variables significantly predicted the pattern of missingness or were associated with stage. These variables were included in the imputation models. In all models, we included vital status, the non-linear effect of the log cumulative excess hazard and the non-linear effect of age at diagnosis. Where necessary, we also included subsite, year of diagnosis and interactions between the log cumulative excess hazard and age, year and subsite. We ran each imputation model 15 times and combined the results under Rubin's rules <ref type="bibr">(White et al, 2011)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Net survival was modelled on the log cumulative excess hazard scale in a flexible parametric framework using the <rs type="software">stpm2</rs> (Lambert and Royston, 2009) command in <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC3619080-software-101">Stata</rs> version <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC3619080-software-101">12</rs> (<rs type="publisher" corresp="#PMC3619080-software-101">StataCorp LP</rs>, College Station, TX, USA). The availability of follow-up data beyond the last boundary for which we want to estimate survival is important for the stability of the model, so we present survival estimates up to 3 years, even though we had longer follow-up for some patients <ref type="bibr">(Remontet et al, 2007)</ref>. We also present the excess hazard, the mortality counterpart to net survival, which is the instantaneous rate of dying from breast cancer, over and above all other causes of death, and which shows how breast cancer mortality changes with time after diagnosis.</p>

            <p>In the next step, we explain the choice of our preferred model. As expected, OLS estimates of parameter &#961; are somehow larger than those of FE. However, reported point estimates of parameters using bias-corrected FE (we employed <ref type="bibr">Bruno, 2005</ref> <rs type="software">Stata routine</rs>) are almost the same as the FE estimates, which suggest that the Nickell bias seems negligible in our context (and that OLS estimates suffer from omitted variable bias). Also the significance of country dummies suggests that OLS estimates may not be the most reliable ones. Finally, it should be noted that the FE estimates have a relatively small variance, especially if compared to consistent estimators as GMM <ref type="bibr">(M&#225;ty&#225;s and Sevestre, 2008)</ref> or bias-corrected FE. For these reasons, we choose the simple FE estimator as the preferred one. Regarding the specification tests, the Arellano-Bond test for autocorrelation shows that including the lagged dependent variable and year dummies reduces problems with autocorrelation. At no reasonable significance level, the null hypothesis (i.e. that there is no autocorrelation) should be rejected. To deal with heterogeneity we use robust SEs.</p>

Multilevel modelling is designed to handle hierarchically nested data, allowing for missing outcome data, and accounting for variation both between participants and within patients over time.

All models included random intercepts to account for variation in the outcome variable across individuals. Assessment time was included as a dummy coded variable, with a random time slope to allow for variation in change in the outcome over time across individuals. Alongside the b coefficients, confidence intervals and P-values, we also calculated standardized mean difference effect sizes, to provide an estimate of the standardized effect size of depression/anxiety status on physical health outcomes.</p>

            <p>These illustrative calculations show that not all taxpayers face lower marginal tax rates as a result of the Tax Reform Act. More detailed information on distributional changes in 1988 marginal tax rates is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The figure reports calculations based on the <rs type="software" xml:id="10.1257%2Fjep.1.1.101-software-100">TAXSIM</rs> model of the <rs type="publisher" corresp="#10.1257%2Fjep.1.1.101-software-100">National Bureau of Economic Research</rs>. <rs type="software">TAXSIM</rs> computes marginal tax rates and tax payments for a synthetic population of over 30,000 1988 taxpayers, constructed by extrapolating from actual 1983 tax returns in the 1983 IRS Public Use Tax Return data file. The calculations suggest that 29.3 million taxpayers (27.3 percent of the total) will face higher marginal rates after the tax reform than before. An additional 14.8 million (13.8 percent) face the same marginal rate under the new law as they would have under old law. Increased marginal tax rates are especially prevalent among non-itemizers, the elderly, and low income earners who are not eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit. Although the majority of taxpayers (58.9 percent) do receive rate reductions, only 11.2 percent receive reductions of more than ten percentage points. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">4</ref> One important aspect of the Tax Reform Act that Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> does not reveal is the increased number of low income households that either pay no taxes or receive rebates. <rs type="software">TAXSIM</rs> calculations indicate that 5.9 million households will be removed from the federal tax rolls as a result of changes in the personal exemption and the <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">4</ref> These calculations weight each tax return equally. Similar findings emerge when we weight tax returns by married couples twice as heavily as those by single persons; 12.1 percent receive marginal rate reductions of 10 percent or more, 11.5 percent face the same marginal rates before and after the reform, and 22.3 percent face higher marginal rates.</p>
            <p>The marginal tax rate facing the average married woman depends on the amount of labor she chooses to supply. For her first hour of work, her marginal tax rate is 15 percent under the new law, compared with 16.2 percent (.90 times 18 percent, due to the ten percent two-earner deduction) under the old law. The two earner deduction influenced marginal work incentives for most couples. <rs type="software">TAXSIM</rs> shows that only 6.1 percent of two-earner couples would have incomes in 1988 that caused the $3000 deduction constraint to bind. The average married woman's marginal tax rate at part-time work, twenty hours per week, decreases from 22.5 percent (.90 of 25 percent) to 15 percent because of the tax reform. This rate change is probably the major determinant of the increase in labor supply that we found. At full-time work, the average married woman faces a marginal rate of 28 percent, which is a slight reduction from her 29.7 percent rate (.90 times .33) under old law.</p>
            <p>Consider the impact of the tax reform on incentives to save through traditional taxable investments such as bonds, corporate stock, and bank accounts. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> The new bill alters the after-tax return to private saving in two ways. First, by lowering marginal tax rates on most assets, it shrinks the tax wedge between pre-tax and post-tax returns. Calculations with the <rs type="software">TAXSIM</rs> model illustrate this effect. In 1988, the average marginal tax rate on interest income will be 21.7 percent, compared with 25.8 percent under the old law. The change in marginal tax rates on corporate dividends is even more pronounced, from 33.4 percent to 25.3 percent, although the net effect on the equity tax wedge is smaller because the capital gains tax rate is increased. 18 Some taxpayers receive larger marginal rate reductions, but as <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">King and Leape (1985)</ref> show, these investors already hold lightly-taxed assets such as high-growth corporate stock and tax-exempt debt.</p>
            <p>The Tax Reform Act significantly increases the disposable income of low-income households who may be subject to liquidity constraints. <rs type="software">TAXSIM</rs> estimates suggest that in 1988 the new law will lower taxes on those with adjusted gross incomes of less than $20,000 by $4.8 billion per year. By comparison, it raises total tax payments by households with AGIs above $75,000 by $5.8 billion annually. These redistributive effects will reduce the aggregate savings rate.</p>

            <p>With the MouseGene 2.0 ST Affymetrix chip, we found not only protein-coding genes that correlate with Rpe65 but also microRNAs and non-coding RNAs. When we examined the top 500 correlates of Rpe65 (all of which have a correlation higher than 0 <ref type="table">2</ref>). Using the bioinformatics tools on <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC4626778-software-100">TargetScan</rs> (<rs type="url" corresp="#PMC4626778-100">Targetscan. org</rs>) <ref type="bibr">[22-24]</ref>, we predicted targets for each microRNA from the top 500 correlates of Rpe65. One microRNA, Mir666, did not appear on the <rs type="software">TargetScan</rs> website. The remaining four microRNAs appeared on the website. When the microRNAs were scanned for targets, Mir98 had 29 targets in the RPE signature, Mir449a had 14 targets, Mir301b had 13 targets, and Mir28b had one target. This type of analysis may be one approach to constructing and understanding microarray networks within a specific cell type such as the mouse RPE.</p>

            <p>From 2006, miRBase provided a set of microRNA target predictions, branded miRBase targets, in collaboration with the Enright lab <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref>. In 2009, the miRBase targets resource was devolved back into the Enright lab at the EBI, and rebranded microCosm. In its place, we will develop an aggregation service that integrates microRNA target predictions from all the popular target prediction sites [for example, <rs type="software">TargetScan</rs> <ref type="bibr">(19)</ref>, <rs type="software">PicTar</rs> (20), <rs type="software">microCosm</rs>, <rs type="software">DIANA-microT</rs> (21), <rs type="software">microrna.org</rs> <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>], together with lists of validated microRNA target sites [currently curated by resources such as TarBase (23), miRecords <ref type="bibr">(24)</ref>, miRTarBase]. This will initially involve displaying the top hits from each algorithm on existing miRBase sequence pages. In the longer term, an interface to search for hits from the aggregated algorithms will be developed, and consensus predictions from subsets of the algorithms will be provided. All results will link to the original data sources. To eliminate any long-term curation burden, we will accept depositions of microRNA target predictions and validated targets from users and target prediction groups.</p>
            <p>As discussed, the majority of the evidence supporting microRNA annotations now comes from deep-sequencing experiments. We have developed an interface to view reads from RNA deep-sequencing data mapped to microRNA loci on the miRBase web site. Briefly, we identify entries in the Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih .gov/geo/) with short-read data that map to references discovering novel microRNAs. We extract the read sequences and counts from the GEO entry and map the reads to the set of miRBase hairpin sequences for a given organism using <rs type="software">Bowtie</rs> (6) allowing at most two mismatches between the read and the hairpin sequence. The first deep-sequencing data sets incorporated into miRBase are from human, Drosophila melanogaster, Arabidopsis thaliana, rice and three nematode genomes. Additional data sets will be added rapidly. Ideally, all microRNA sequences submitted to miRBase will be linked to GEO submissions, or followed by the submission of the deep-sequencing data for inclusion in miRBase. The view of deep-sequencing data can be accessed from miRBase stem-loop and mature pages (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Reads can be filtered by the number of mismatches to the hairpin sequence, the read count and by experiment. Each experiment is annotated with species, tissue, stage and methodology information. These tags enable the user to search for experiments by tissue expression on the <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC3013655-software-100">miRBase search page</rs> (<rs type="url" corresp="#PMC3013655-software-100">http://www.mirbase.org/search.shtml</rs>). Read counts for mature microRNAs are commonly used as a proxy for relative expression levels. As the number of deepsequencing experiments increases, these data provide extensive information about the expression profiles of microRNAs across tissues, stages and organisms. A good example of the power of these data can be seen in the small RNA data made available through the MODENCODE project for D. melanogaster <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. The patterns of read mappings also provide valuable evidence for relative abundance of mature sequences from different arms, for isoforms of mature microRNA sequences, and for the confidence in a given microRNA annotation. For example, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows a number of isoforms of mature microRNAs derived from both arms of the dme-mir-317 hairpin precursor. The dominant mature sequence from the 3 0 -arm is 21 nt in length, whereas the mature sequence annotated in miRBase 16 is extended to 24 nt. The 5 0 -mature sequence is unannotated in miRBase 16. The miRBase view of read data therefore provides the user with a clear picture of the profile of short RNAs generated from a microRNA locus, and facilitates the correction of errors and omissions in future releases.</p>

            <p>The nucleotide sequences of the cDNA clones used for probe preparation were taken as query in <rs type="software">BLASTN</rs> search in Rice Genome Annotation Project Database (http://rice.plantbiology. msu.edu/) which revealed that regions of clones used for probe preparation were specific to the corresponding genes, thus giving a clear signal on northern blots. In case of OsSOS genes, we found that OsSOS2 and OsSOS3 were expressed in diurnal manner. Diurnal rhythms of these two genes have a characteristic waveform, described by peaks and troughs. OsSOS3, with a phase of 24 h show higher expression level during night. Its expression shoots up in night and goes down during day, creating rhythmicity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). Similarly, the transcript of OsSOS2 also shows a clear oscillation profile. MRNA levels of OsSOS2 cycles in lightdark periods, showing higher expression around the transition period of light to dark with a period of 24 h (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>). The amplitude of OsSOS2 diurnal expression was higher in comparison to that of OsSOS3. mRNA level of OsSOS1 transcript fluctuates profiles in sos1, sos2 and sos3 mutants implicating this as transcriptional output requiring all components of the SOS pathway. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">39</ref> Expression of CCR1 as well as its homolog CCR2 is regulated by diurnal rhythm. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">40</ref> Not only downstream genes of SOS pathway, but also the interacting partners of SOS pathway show the diurnal rhythm. It has been reported that SOS2 interacts with catalase 2 (CAT2) and catalase 3 (CAT3) connecting SOS2 to H 2 O 2 metabolism and signaling. Expression of CAT2 is under circadian control, with the highest expression during the light period, consistent with a primary role in detoxifying H 2 O 2 derived from photosynthesis or photorespiration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">41</ref> Interestingly, CAT3 is also circadian regulated, but in the opposite manner as CAT2. CAT3 between diurnal rhythm of SOS pathway genes and salinity stress tolerance. In Arabidopsis, elimination of SOS1 leads to the changes in expression of genes related to circadian rhythm. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">38</ref> It suggests that though SOS1 does not show any diurnal rhythm but it regulates diurnal rhythm of several other genes. It also indicates toward unknown and unexplored connection between SOS pathway and circadian clock.</p>

In addition, 75-bp paired-end transcriptome sequence reads were produced for the tumors (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). Sequence reads from the whole-genome libraries were aligned to the human reference genome (build GRCh37) using the Burrows-Wheeler alignment (BWA) tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Li and Durbin 2010)</ref>.

            <p>Finally, we test the robustness of our findings to the use of different samples and explore demographic heterogeneity in the effect of volatility on migration. As we note in the beginning of this section, there is a tradeoff between the specificity and the precision with which we can measure http://mattholian.blogspot.com/2013/05/central-business-district-geocodes.html and used in <ref type="bibr">Holian and Kahn [2015bb]</ref>).

Finally, we used the crosswalk detailed above to match CBSAs to MSAs. When multiple CBSAs matched to an MSA, we used the average distance. Because the crosswalk uses more recent MSA definitions than IPUMS, we exclude metropolitan areas that do not match uniquely to the MSAs in the crosswalk (indicating code changes between the crosswalk and IPUMS definitions). <ref type="bibr">24</ref> That is, we replace the l jt and r jt in the formulae given above with the sample analogs of E&#240;q hjt jh 6 &#188; i&#222; and Ef&#189;q hjt 2E&#240;q hjt jh 6 &#188; i&#222; 2 jh 6 &#188; ig 1=2 .</p>

            <p>We used a set of error-correcting barcodes for distinguishing different data sets pooled into a single Illumina Genome Analyser IIx flow cell lane. The 76-bp long sequencing reads were checked for starting exactly with the barcode (4 bp) followed by the adapter sequence (23 bp for SB, 24 bp for PB and 22-bp for Tol2). The adapter for SB ended with 'TA' and the adapter for PB with 'TTAA' indicating transposase-mediated transposition events as opposed to random integration. The remaining parts of the reads (between 48 and 50 bp) were mapped using <rs type="software">Bowtie</rs> <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(62)</ref> to the chromosomes of the human genome (NCBI built GRCh37/hg19, February 2009) excluding the Y-chromosome because HeLa is a female cell line. Only reads occurring without mismatches at a single genomic position (exact uniquely mapped reads) were used for the subsequent analysis. Multiple reads mapping to the same genomic position and strand were treated as a single integration site. To improve the data quality, we discarded all sites supported by &lt;10 reads. In case of the SB data sets, we only accepted sites having 'TA' adjacent to the integration site. In case of the PB data sets, we only accepted sites having 'TTAA' adjacent to the integration site. For the statistical analysis, we generated three control sets, each containing 10 000 sites, which were randomly selected from inside of contigs on human chromosomes excluding the Y-chromosome. For the SB control set, only control sites adjacent to 'TA' were selected, and for the PB control set, only control sites adjacent to 'TTAA' were selected. Databases of genomic regions (RefSeq) were downloaded from UCSC (http:// genome.ucsc.edu). We used the H3K27me3 domains determined by Cuddapah et al. bcgsc.ca/data/histone-modification) were mapped to the human genome using <rs type="software">Bowtie</rs>, then peaks were called using MACS ( <ref type="formula">65</ref>), and H3K4me1/3 domains are then defined as 5-kb windows around the centers of the peaks.

The data were integrated and scaled using XDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>. The crystals belonged to space group P2 1 22 1 with the unit cell dimensions a &#1005; 35.7 &#197;, b &#1005; 42.7 &#197;, and c &#1005; 95.1 &#197;. The phases and electron density map were obtained by molecular replacement using <rs type="software">Phaser</rs> running in the <rs type="software">CCP4</rs> program interface with one complex in the asymmetric unit. Refinement was done using <rs type="software">COOT</rs> <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref> and <rs type="software">REFMAC5</rs> <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>. Well defined electron density was obtained for GLP-1 residues Thr 11 *-Val 33 * and for ECD residues Val 30 -Glu 128 . Poor density was observed for GLP-1 residues Gly 10 *, Lys 34 *, and Gly 35 * and ECD residues Thr 29 and Asn 115 . No electron density was observed for His 7 *-Glu 9 * and Arg 36 *-Gly 37 * of GLP-1. Our final structure contains GLP-1 residues Gly 10 *-Gly 35 * and ECD residues Thr 29 -Glu 128 , but it should be noted that the conformation of Lys 34 * of GLP-1 is very uncertain, and because of the poor density we have chosen to show Asn 115 as Gly. The final GLP-1-bound ECD structure has 116 residues in preferred regions, 5 in allowed regions and only 1 outlier (Glu 68 in the &#9252;-turn between &#9252; 1 and &#9252; 2 shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>) in the Ramachandran plot.

            <p>Structure Solution and Refinement-Although both crystal forms appeared to have P6 1 22 symmetry, subsequent analysis indicated that each had P6 1 symmetry and were almost perfectly merohedrally twinned. The crystals obtained with Sgf11 (residues 7-33) diffracted isotropically to a resolution of 2.11 &#197;, whereas those using residues 1-33 gave very anisotropic diffraction extending to 2.4 &#197; resolution along the c axis, but to only 2.7 &#197; resolution along the a and b axes. Molecular replacement using residues 21-90 of Sus1 from the Sac3-Sus1-Cdc31 complex (10) in <rs type="software">PHASER</rs> (<rs type="software">CCP4</rs>) gave a solution for four chains in the asymmetric unit of the Sgf11-(7-33)-Sus1 crystals, which was then refined using twinned refinement option in <rs type="software">PHENIX</rs> (<ref type="bibr">37</ref>) employing the twinning operator (h, -h-k, -l) and with R free flags set appropriately. Alternating cycles of refinement and rebuilding in COOT generated a model with an R-factor of 19.0% (R free &#1005; 23.7%), excellent geometry (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) and a Mol-Probity score of 1.41 (99th percentile). Because of the presence of merohedral symmetry, stringent geometric constraints were applied, and these were then optimized to minimize the R free value during refinement. TLS parameters were obtained from the TLS website <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(38)</ref>. The model obtained for the Sgf11-(7-33)-Sus1 crystals was then used to solve the Sgf11-(1-33)-Sus1 crystals using molecular replacement, which, after iterative cycles of refinement and rebuilding, gave a model with an R-factor of 21.3% (R free &#1005; 25.3%) and excellent geometry (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p>

            <p>Single particle reconstruction. Defocus parameters for each micrograph were determined with the MRC program <rs type="software">CTFFIND3</rs> (ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47)</ref>. Micrographs were corrected for the phase reversals of the contrast transfer function using <rs type="software">SPIDER</rs> <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> and binned to 3.26 &#197; per pixel before particles (straight segments of the rod-like structures) were manually picked in <rs type="software">Boxer</rs> <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> and extracted into 80 by 80 pixel boxes. The particles were filtered between 100 and 10 &#197; and normalized using <rs type="software">IMAGIC</rs> <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> . Particles were initially aligned to a vertical rectangle and the aligned images were then classified using multivariate statistical analysis (MSA) into classes containing on average 25 images. Classes were manually inspected and ones showing the highest similarity between the individual particles and their corresponding class average were selected for multi-reference alignment (MRA). Following two rounds of MRA/MSA, 3D reconstructions were calculated from the class averages showing the clearest features, using helical symmetry in <rs type="software">SPIDER</rs>. The helical pitch repeat was estimated by helically averaging the clearest tomogram reconstruction over a range of repeat values and cross-correlating the resulting averages with the unaveraged tomographic reconstruction in <rs type="software">CHIMERA</rs>. This comparison gave a clear optimum for the helical repeat, at 7.8 nm, and this value was used for helical reconstruction of the single particle class averages. Models from six different class averages, containing a total of 155 segments, were averaged in <rs type="software">CHIMERA</rs>. As it was not possible to determine a subunit repeat from diffraction patterns of the negatively stained images, probably due to the flexible nature of the helical oligomer, the 3D maps were reconstructed with a subunit repeat of 1 pixel (3.3 &#197;) to generate continuous helices.  MgSO 4 , 0.5 mM CaCl 2 , 25 mM NaHCO 3 , 25 mM glucose, 1.25 mM NaH 2 PO 4 and 75 mM sucrose. Parasagital sections (350 mm) were prepared on a Leica VT1000S vibratome using stainless steel razor blades (Campden, Loughborough, UK). Slices were immediately transferred to a holding chamber (BSC-PC, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) containing ACSF: 119 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.3 mM MgSO 4 , 2.5 mM CaCl 2 , 26.2 mM NaHCO 3 , 11 mM glucose and 1.25 mM NaH 2 PO 4 . Circulating ACSF was continuously bubbled with a mixture of 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 and slices allowed to recover for at least 90 min at room temperature.</p>
            <p>Extracellular recordings were performed as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> . Briefly, slices were submerged in a recording chamber and perfused with oxygenated ACSF at a rate of 2-3 ml min &#192; 1 and the perfusate warmed to 30 &#176;C. A stainless steel microelectrode (FHC, Bowdoin, USA) was used to stimulate Schaffer collateral fibres, and extracellular field EPSPs were recorded from stratum radiatum of CA1 using a glass microelectrode. EPSPs were recorded using an Axopatch 1D in tandem with a Digidata 1440A digitiser (Axon Instruments). Data were collected using <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC3908552-software-100">pClamp</rs> <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC3908552-software-100">10</rs> software and analysed using <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC3908552-software-101">Clampfit</rs> <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC3908552-software-101">10.2</rs> (<rs type="publisher" corresp="#PMC3908552-software-101">Molecular Devices). For all experiments, test stimuli were given once every 30 s (0.033 Hz), and the stimulus intensity was set to give a baseline fEPSP of 40-50% of the maximal response. A baseline was recorded for at least 20 min before application of Ab. In experiments using differentially aggregated Ab (stock solutions were diluted 1:200 into ACSF to produce nominal concentrations of 500 nM based on the starting weight of Ab 1-42 monomer), the sample was added to the perfusate 30 min before induction of LTP. LTP was induced by theta burst stimulation (10 bursts of 4 stimuli at 100 Hz, with an interburst interval of 200 ms) given at baseline intensity. The ACSF was recycled using peristaltic pumps (101 U/R, Watson-Marlow, UK) ensuring that the Ab was present for the duration of the experiment. LTP is expressed as the mean&#177;s.e.m. % of baseline fEPSP slope. Statistical comparisons used analysis of variance with post hoc Tukey-Kramer test or unpaired Student's t-test where appropriate.</p>
            <p>Cell-based membrane leakage. Ab-induced membrane permeabilization was assessed by monitoring calcein-AM leakage, as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> . PrPoverexpressing and knockdown murine neuroblastoma (PK1) cells (D-Gen Ltd) <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> were seeded on coverslips overnight and fixed for 30 min with PBS-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde the next day. Cells were then loaded with 3 mM calcein-AM (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 &#176;C, washed four times with PBS and subsequently exposed to 500 nM differentially aggregated Ab for 1 h at 37 &#176;C. Cells were washed four times with PBS, mounted using 4 0 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)containing medium (Abcam) and cells were visualized using a Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM 510). Images were acquired using a Plan-Neofluar 40x/1.3 Oil DIC objective and l ex &#188; 405 nm (DAPI) or 488 nm (calcein-AM), with <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC3908552-software-102">ImageJ</rs> software (<rs type="publisher" corresp="#PMC3908552-software-102">NIH</rs>) used to quantify images.

Cells were then incubated for 1 h at 4 &#176;C with 0.6 mg ml &#192; 1 ICSM18 (in PBS), washed four times with PBS, and subsequently incubated for 1 h at 4 &#176;C with 2 mg ml &#192; 1 fluoresceinlabelled anti-mouse IgG antibody (in PBS). Cells were washed a further four times with PBS, mounted and visualized by confocal microscopy (l ex &#188; 488 nm for fluorescein).</p>
            <p>Tomography. Grids were prepared as described for negative stain analysis. Dual axis tilt series were acquired on an FEI Tecnai F20 microscope operating at 200 kV (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b,d</ref>) or an FEI Tecnai T12 electron microscope operating at 120 kV (Fig. <ref type="figure">4i</ref>). The tilt range was between &#192; 68&#176;and &#254; 68&#176;with 2&#176;increments and the defocus ranged from 1.5 to 3 mm. Images were either recorded on a 4 k &#194; 4 k CCD camera (Gatan) at a magnification of 38,000 giving a pixel size of 3.92 &#197; (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b,d</ref>) or on a 1 k &#194; 1 k CCD camera (Gatan) at a magnification of 42,000 with a pixel size of 4.15 &#197; (Fig. <ref type="figure">4i</ref>). Tomograms were reconstructed from the tilt series with <rs type="software">IMOD</rs> <ref type="bibr">46</ref> software using local patch tracking for alignment. From the final tomograms, segments of oligomers showing ordered structural features were extracted and visually inspected in <rs type="software">CHIMERA</rs>. Volumes that showed strong helical features were converted to SPIDER format and low-pass filtered and masked to remove noise.</p>

            <p>The enzymatic activities of MMP-2 and MMP -9 were analyzed by gelatin zymography. Briefly, serum-free culture supernatant fractions were collected and mixed at a 1:1 ratio with non-reducing sample buffer (2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 50 mM Tris-HCl (PH 6.8), 10% glycerol, and 0.001% bromophenol blue for preparing samples. The samples were electrophoresed on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) containing 0.1% gelatin. After separation of proteins, the gel was washed twice with washing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 2.5% triton X-100) and then treated with incubation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl at PH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl 2 , and 0.02% NaN 3 ) at 37 &#176;C for 24 hr. After incubation, the gels were stained (0.5% coomassie blue, 10% metanol, and 5% acetic acid) and then destained (20% methanol and 10% acetic acid). MMPs were detected as a clear zone on the blue background.

            <p>The levels of surface markers expressed on HUVECs were assessed using flow cytometry. After 24 hours of coculture or monoculture in the absence or presence of HANPs (100 &#181;g/mL), HUVECs were released from the wells after washing with PBS. The following mouse antihuman monoclonal antibodies were used: intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) (cluster of differentiation [CD]54-PE; eBioscience, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA); vascular CAM-1 (VCAM-1) (CD106 fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer 1; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA); E-selectin (CD62E-APC; BD Biosciences); and vWF (BD Biosciences).

            <p>MLST. Genomic DNA extraction was performed as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(65)</ref>. Eight loci were amplified and sequenced-seven International Society for Human and Animal Mycology (ISHAM) consensus loci CAP59, GPD1, IGS1, LAC1, PLB1, SOD1, and URA5 (23) and the optional highly polymorphic TEF1 locus ( <ref type="formula">24</ref>). An additional LAC1Ra primer was developed to replace the consensus primer, which was not sufficiently specific for LAC1 amplification in our samples. All primers are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S2</ref> in the supplemental material. MLST PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, excised, purified, and sequenced. Sequence assembly was performed with <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC3448160-software-100">Sequencher</rs> <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC3448160-software-100">4.9</rs> software (<rs type="publisher" corresp="#PMC3448160-software-100">Genecodes</rs>, Ann Arbor, MI).

A total of 4,430 characters were analyzed: 4,315 characters were constant, 71 variable characters were parsimony uninformative, and 44 characters were parsimony informative. Sequences for all loci for each UgCl sample were concatenated and subjected to maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and bootstrap analyses using <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC3448160-software-102">PAUP</rs><rs type="version" corresp="#PMC3448160-software-102">4.0b10</rs> software. Nonredundant allelic sets were compiled using the Non-redundant databases (NRDB) web tool (http://pubmlst.org). Novel allele sequences were deposited in MLST.net (http://www.MLST .net), BioloMICS.net, and BLAST public databases. Sequence types were identified as combinations of allelic types for individual loci based on NRDB data. Sequence types were subjected to Burst analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> to produce a putative evolutionary relationship between clusters of closely related sequence types. A minimum spanning tree was produced from the sequence types with Prim's algorithm combined with Burst clustering.</p>

The enrichment of real and permuted modules in gene subsets from the NCBI gene database was calculated using <rs type="software">LitVAn</rs> <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. We report only modules with annotations that have a significant FDR of 0.05 or better. Depending on context, we discuss the proximity of a gene to a SNP in several ways: A SNP may be 'in the span of the gene', i.e. the SNP resides between the ENSEMBL (24) transcription start site and stop codon of the gene; 'closest to the gene', i.e. this gene spans the closest among all spanned sites on either direction; or 'close to the gene'-means the SNP is within 1 Mb of a site spanned by the gene. We define a cis main SNP when the main SNP is within 1 Mb of one or more transcripts in the module. We define a trans main SNP when the main SNP is 1 Mb or further of all the transcripts in the module.</p>
            <p>Of the 114 modules, 26 (22.8%) were reported as enriched in any category. This contrasts with modules in 100 permuted data sets, where 12.8 &#177; 2.7% of the modules show any functional enrichment (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6</ref>) and (ii) locus annotation of the main and secondary SNPs of each module, as reflected in the existing literature, Ensembl (24) and wikigenes <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. These sources are independent for modules with trans main SNP. We observe similar annotations of modules from the two sources of information. This independent cross validation provides support for our methodology. Additional support comes from intersecting the 94 main loci with the 2626 unique genes (2212 among the 18 873 transcripts available for analysis in this work) reported to house GWAS SNPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. We find an overlap of 21 genes (hypergeometric P = 1.1 &#194; 10 &#192;3 ).</p>

            <p>For instance, one of the available workflows (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) can analyse mRNA and miRNA expression data (expression and fold change). Suppressed genes are automatically matched with overexpressed miRNAs (and vice versa). The workflow performs enrichment analysis of experimentally validated targets derived from <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC3692048-software-100">DIANA-TarBase</rs> <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC3692048-software-100">v6.0</rs> (<ref type="bibr">3</ref>) or/and predicted interactions from microT-CDS. This step is considered crucial to identify miRNAs that significantly regulate the differentially expressed genes.</p>
            <p>Initial research efforts have unveiled that miRNAs regulated gene expression through their binding on the 3 0 UTR of protein-coding genes (2). However, accumulated experimental evidence has revealed that miRNA-binding sites within coding sequences are also functional in controlling gene expression <ref type="bibr">(11)</ref>. The new algorithm microT-CDS (7) can identify miRNA targets in 3 0 UTR, as well as in CDS regions. Further details on the microT-CDS algorithm and the utilized training sets can be found in the relevant publication by Reczko et al. <ref type="bibr">(7)</ref>. <rs type="software">DIANA-microT-CDS</rs> provides increased accuracy and the highest sensitivity at any level of specificity over other available state-of-the-art implementations, when tested against pulsed stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (pSILAC) proteomics data sets <ref type="bibr">(12)</ref>.</p>

            <p>Samples were analyzed flow cytometrically within 30 months of collection, with a median time until analysis of 15 months. The frozen PBMC samples were thawed quickly and washed in warm medium. Samples were first stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Yellow Stain (Invitrogen) in PBS. After washing, cells were stained with a cocktail of antibodies in PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 0.1% EDTA. The following anti-human monoclonal antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences (Stockholm, Sweden): anti-CD3-FITC (clone: HIT3a), CD4-APCH7 (RPA-T4), CD8-PerCpCy5.5 (SK1), CD16-V450 (3G8) CD56-APC (B159). The antibodies to NCRs NKp30-PE (AF29-4D12), NKp46-APC (9E2) were purchased from Miltenyi Biotec. Samples were collected via a 4-laser BD LSRFortessa SORP (405, 488, 532, and 640 nm; BD Biosciences).

            <p>The literature search of studies was conducted using Medline (via PubMed), Embase, PsychINFO, ProQuest, and the Occupational Health and Safety reference collection. The database search was performed with a combination of Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and/or keywords (see Supplementary Data for the search strategy of the major databases used). An adapted search strategy was used to search all the databases from their start date to 1 November 2011, when we began to draft the manuscript. Search results were downloaded and imported directly into <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC3579337-software-100">EndNote</rs>, version <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC3579337-software-100">X4</rs>. To reduce language bias, no language restrictions were applied. An information scientist helped us develop and conduct an optimal search strategy. To identify other relevant studies, we manually searched the bibliographic reference lists of the included studies.</p>
            <p>We used a three-step process to select the studies. First, using <rs type="software">EndNote</rs>, we eliminated exact duplicate articles. Second, to discard irrelevant studies, two authors (L.G. and M.-C.B.) screened all titles identified through the electronic databases search. Third, to select studies that met our inclusion criteria from the remaining articles, L.G. and M.-C.B. read abstracts and full texts using a study selection form built specifically for this purpose. If the results of a study were reported in more than one publication, only the publication with the most complete results was retained. Only if publications on the same study focused on different outcomes or different populations did we include them. To avoid double counting data from multiple publications, we juxtaposed author names, sample sizes, and outcomes. Using k statistics, we assessed interreviewer agreement on the selection process steps: for title evaluation ( If consensus could not be reached, L.G. made the final decision. The following information was extracted from each study article: author names, year of publication, study design, country, period of data collection, description of participants, age, and data on diabetes assessment (type of diabetes, data collection, and method). In addition, we extracted the following details for each study article: number of individuals with and without diabetes, type of outcome (definition and data collection and assessment methods), statistical analysis, number of days lost per year, percentage of individuals with the outcome, number of years retired earlier, and summary measure of dependent variable effect with 95% CI or P value. In the included studies different units of time (week, month, or year) were used to report data on the productivity outcomes. In consequence we calculated, when necessary, the number of days lost per year to allow comparison between studies. When data on the number of hours worked per week and the number of weeks worked per year were missing, we assumed that individuals were working 40 h per week and 50 weeks a year. Whenever more than one summary measure was reported for an outcome, the most adjusted (summary measure from the model including highest number of variables) was considered. Crude relative risks were calculated each time the effect size was not reported, provided the article supplied sufficient information. Missing information was obtained by contacting corresponding authors and consulting survey web sites. We did not impute missing data. They also assessed the quality of casecontrol studies using the NOS for casecontrol studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. Both scales address three domains: 1) selection of study groups (four items for case-control studies and three items for cohort studies [we removed one item for cohort studiesd"demonstration that outcome of interest was not present at start of study"dbecause it was irrelevant to our outcomes]), 2) comparability of these groups (one item), and 3) ascertainment of either exposure or outcome of interest (three items). A study could be awarded a maximum of one star for each item within the selection and outcome categories and a maximum of two stars for comparability. The overall quality rating was the sum of the stars (maximum of eight stars for cohort and nine for casecontrol studies, respectively). To evaluate the quality of cross-sectional studies, we modified the NOS for cohort studies. In the selection and outcome sections, three of the nine itemsd"demonstration that outcome of interest was not present at start of study," "was follow-up long enough for outcomes to occur?" and "adequacy of follow-up"dwere removed since they are not applicable to cross-sectional studies. Thus a maximum of six stars could be awarded. We regarded a study as having a low risk of bias if it was allocated the maximum number of stars for its design. </p>

            <p>Although improvements in computer gene-finding programs have made it relatively easy to detect genes in uncharacterized genomic DNA sequences, it remains difficult to determine how many exons and introns there are in a given sequence and what are the exact boundaries between them. As we know, gene identification methods may be classified as recognition of protein coding regions and recognition of functional sites of genes. In the past two decades, many new methods for finding distinctive features of protein coding regions have been presented, including the algorithms based on codon usage (1 ), dicodon usage (2 ), 3-base periodicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, and the fifth-order phase Markov chain model <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6 )</ref>. Although great progress has been made, the situation is still far from being perfect. Undoubtedly, the fifth-order Markov chain model has a better identification accuracy, since this method makes full use of the local statistical characteristics of base distribution in three frames of coding sequences. However, it still has its shortcomings; the parameters determined based on previously discovered sequences cannot be applied to identify genes on different sequences with the same accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7 )</ref>. Moreover, it needs a large data set to train the bulky parameters, whose number is nearly five thousand. In recent years, several new algorithms have been proposed, such as <rs type="software">MZEF</rs> <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8 )</ref>, <rs type="software">GLIMMER</rs> <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9 )</ref>, <rs type="software">MOR-GAN</rs>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10 )</ref>, <rs type="software">GeneMark.hmm</rs> <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11 )</ref>, <rs type="software">GENESCAN</rs> <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12 )</ref>, <rs type="software">FGENESH</rs> <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13 )</ref>, and so on <ref type="bibr">(14 , 15 )</ref>.

            <p>The deconstruction of the so-called "tragedy" of the commons, based on the analysis of the "Ostrom School" and the reference to the design principles of commons institutions, is the first building block of the German discourse. The second one is the new manner of production demonstrated through the development of so-called digital commons such as Wikipedia and open source software. Just like the compilation of encyclopaedic knowledge in Wikipedia, open source software is originally programmed by volunteers who do the work because they enjoy what they are doing and find it useful. A distinctive feature of open source as compared to conventional software production is that in the latter case all the program code, the core of the respective products, is kept secret and unchangeable for users, while in the former case it is freely accessible for everybody. People can download the programs, use them, and improve them. In many cases this is associated with a copyleft license 2 (e.g. GNU General Public License or some of the Creative Commons licenses) that allows these activities only as long as what comes out of that process remains freely accessible. The advantage of such licenses is that they can ensure that the modifications and extensions that are made will remain free. Using copyright legislation, they protect the licensed products against enclosure attempts. This allowed well accepted and widely used free web browsers such as <rs type="software">Firefox</rs>, free office packages such as <rs type="software">Libre Office</rs>, and even free operating systems (<rs type="software">Linux</rs>) to be created, improved, and distributed. This is particularly interesting since software is not only a pure consumption good but also a means of production that has become increasingly crucial for many production processes. This (slightly misleadingly dubbed) immaterial production is supplemented more and more by material production projects such as Open Source Ecology (OSE). OSE develops and tests the "Global Village Construction Set," a set of (the presumably most important) tools and machines that will serve the population of an entire village to sustain themselves and live a good life with <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The official name is "Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel." 2 Copyleft describes the act of using copyright legislation in order to make works freely available to the general public. Under some specifications, the product at hand (normally software, text documents, or easily copyable artworks such as music files) may for example be used, distributed, and/or modified under various conditions such as the product shall be used under the same license and/or that the original author is named. a high degree of autonomy. The construction plans are freely accessible and the products are designed and constructed around modularity, reparability, reducing pollution, and the sparing use of natural resources. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> This is in sharp contrast to conventional constructions (and knowledge management) that mainly focus on profitability.</p>
            <p>Free cooperation or association is another crucial principle <ref type="bibr">(Siefkes 2007: 14f.)</ref> including the possibility of "forking," which means to found a new project that does a similar thing (but differing at decisive points) while the old project may still exist. This happened, for example, when some people from the office software project "<rs type="software">Open Office</rs>" were not happy about some decisions taken in the development and communication processes. They founded the counterpart "<rs type="software">Libre Office</rs>" and in doing so forked the project "<rs type="software">Open Office</rs>." Knowing about the differences between the projects, people can freely decide which project they want to join and which product to use. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> That gives great incentives for maintainers to take decisions that are supported by the people using the products, and to an even larger extent to take decisions supported by the contributors. One could call this "structural focus on stakeholders" as opposed to shareholders. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> On free software projects it is quite common to rely on maintainers to take a relevant degree of decisions. This has proven pragmatic and not necessarily authoritarian. People can "fork," they are not dependent on the jobs they are doing, so there is no functional drive for authority to become authoritarian. This maintainer authority is mainly based on reputation, initiative, voluntariness, and practical knowledge and acts instead of structural and personal power (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Siefkes 2009)</ref>. Additionally, needs orientation is a basic underlying principle of peer production. As there is no direct exchange, the structurally antagonistic interests of producers and consumers disappear. Producers do not become active through some abstract value (money/profit) or mere force, but rather through their own (intrinsic) motivations 18 to do the tasks that are needed, which of course is enhanced if people actually need and thus appreciate the products. The distinct separation of paid and unpaid activities (often described as production and reproduction labor) is a fundamental building block of the capitalist method of production. Ideally, this is not the case with commons production as the abstract evaluation mechanism is absent, and there is no money or another equivalent involved. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> It is about contributing voluntarily, and taking what is needed, not on (equivalent) exchange relations. Hence, an equivalent is neither needed nor functional. 20 Furthermore, production and reproduction cannot be said to be separated into different spheres as the production process becomes needs-oriented and ceases being profit-oriented. Thus, we can say that commons are not only based on both production and reproduction, but also that the distinction might even vanish and a transcendence of the two take place. We could name this new category (re)production (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">L&#246;schmann 2013)</ref>.</p>

            <p>We now discuss the results for the complete model. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> We start with the shapes of the individual transition rates as functions of the elapsed durations in the states under consideration. Given the initial level of a transition rate (i.e., upon entry into the state under consideration), the shape of this rate is described by the parameters of the duration dependence function (see the estimates in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Apart from these duration dependence parameters, the specifications only include time-invariant covariates. The rate into temporary work from unemployment is smaller than the rate into regular work. However, once an individual is in temporary employment, the rate 14 Strictly speaking we do not solve for initial conditions since we do not fully observe the previous employment history of all cases. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> The estimates were computed with GAUSS, using the standard maximum likelihood application <rs type="software">MAXLIK</rs>. The programming of the likelihood function was based on a range of available programs for the "Timing of Events" approach. The likelihood function of the base model was optimized in 265 iterations, using the Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb and Shanno (BFGS) optimization algorithm and a numerical gradient with a tolerance level of 10 &#8722;4 for the gradient of the estimated coefficients. Identical results were obtained using different numbers of individuals, a wide range of different starting values, and different optimization algorithms (like the Newton-Raphson method and the Berndt, Hall, Hall and Hausman method). of flowing into regular work is at some time after the start of the search larger than otherwise. One might expect workers who accept a temporary job to be initially strongly attached to that job-for example, for contractual reasons. This is true in some sense. Newly employed temporary workers have a slightly lower rate into regular work than unemployed workers. Until 1 year after the start of the temporary job, the transition rate to regular work is lower than the transition rate from unemployment to regular work. After a period of 1.5 years, however, the transition rate from temporary into regular employment increases substantially. This does not correspond to any binding legal restriction in the length of temporary work (see Section 2), as in e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Guell and Petrongolo (2007)</ref>. After 30 months, we are left with only 225 observations in the data, which makes the estimated hazards, and the observed jumps in the transition rates, rather imprecise. The jumps in the hazard rates could be due to the loss of wage-related unemployment benefits for many of the unemployed.</p>

            <p>As there is no reported crystal structure of HDAC(s) from any Plasmodium species, a homology model of the PkHDAC1 was built using the homology modelling suite in <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC5241585-software-100">Maestro</rs> (<rs type="publisher" corresp="#PMC5241585-software-100">Schr&#8364; odinger</rs> Release, <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC5241585-software-100">2016-1</rs>). The <rs type="software">BLAST</rs> search engine within the suite was used for template searching before model construction. Human HDAC2 (pdb code:3MAX) was chosen as the most suitable template due to its high overall sequence identity (62%) and similarity (81%) with the PkHDAC1 protein, and its high resolution (2.1 &#197;) crystal structure in complex with a small molecule inhibitor. The energybased approach was used to build the final model. The homology model created from <rs type="software">Maestro</rs> was checked for model quality and stereochemistry using <rs type="software">SwissModel</rs> <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kiefer et al., 2009)</ref>.

Ligands were docked in the active site defined by a 15 &#197; radius around the OD2 atom of Asp 262. Each ligand was docked 20 times using scaffold constraint settings to ensure that each hydroxamate mimicked the native binding mode of vorinostat bound in the crystal structure human HDAC2 (pdb code: 4LXZ) during ligand docking simulations.</p>

            <p>Because of the large source of variation among multiple laboratories, no general consensus can be made with regard to the specific ranking of proteins or their magnitude of change. In our experiments the statistical significance was not derived from establishing the significance of the top ranked individual proteins by traditional FDR (55) but rather based on interrogating the rankings based on protein sets using GSEA <ref type="bibr">(28)</ref> methods where the gene sets were derived from external transcriptional data. We also found that results in this study are most strongly supported by laboratories that obtained the greatest depth of protein coverage. Our results suggest that additional biomarker studies should focus on designs that obtain the greatest depth of coverage and that interrogate the data analysis with externally derived hypotheses, perhaps from data integration. Our study could not have led to a positive finding without taking these advantages.</p>
            <p>To evaluate hypothesis 1, we performed Pearson's 2 tests on an over-representation analysis to compare the fraction of proteins annotated as being brain-specific in CSF and the Human Proteome Organization Plasma Proteome Project plasma data (results summarized in Table <ref type="table">IV</ref>). To evaluate hypothesis 2, we used GSEA, which uses a non-parametric Wilcoxon test <ref type="bibr">(40, 41)</ref> to compare the distribution of ratios between brain-specific and non-brain-specific proteins (see "Results"). For hypothesis 3, we coded all brain-derived proteins as up or down based on the sign of their sums of z-scores and all transcripts as up or down based on the sign of their log 2 -fold changes of mRNA from the array and then applied Pearson's 2 tests to evaluate the association (results are summarized in Table <ref type="table">V</ref>).</p>
            <p>Our study also suggests that data integration plays a central role in studies to identify biomarkers as statistical significance could not have been demonstrated without the ability to evaluate changes in predefined groups of proteins using the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) approach.</p>

            <p>In addition, we also identified KEGG JAK-STAT signaling pathway as significantly enriched in EITLs. The higher side qvalue (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">17</ref>) is in this regard not surprising as the activation of JAK-STAT pathway is known to occur through protein phosphorylation and not increased expression of mRNA. More importantly, an outstanding association was identified with genes containing STAT5B binding sites in their promoters, both for the shorter and longer consensus motif. We further confirmed this by GSEA against publicly available gene set of STAT5 target genes. <ref type="bibr">46</ref> There was a significant enrichment between STAT5 targets and genes upregulated in EITL (normalized enrichment score = 1.78, false discovery rate q-value o 0.001; Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">8d</ref>).Gene expression profiling data was validated by real-time PCR of randomly selected genes (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">18</ref>). The values from the two experiments were consistent, although the correlation was not statistically significant because of the small sample size (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>). In summary, JAK-STAT and GPCR signaling pathways were demonstrated as significantly enriched in EITL tumors using two different data sets and methodologies.</p>
            <p>To verify the above by an unrelated approach, we performed gene expression profiling of four EITL tumors, two of CD8&#945;&#945; and two of CD8&#945;&#946; origin. As EITL is suggested to arise from CD8+ IELs, <ref type="bibr">13</ref> we integrated our data with publicly available profile of CD8&#945;&#945; and CD8&#945;&#946; T-cells from healthy donors. <ref type="bibr">44</ref> There was a total of 1760 genes significantly upregulated in EITL tumors (P o 0.05 and fold change &#10878; 1.5; Supplementary Table <ref type="table">16</ref>). GSEA against Molecular Signatures Database gene sets <ref type="bibr">45</ref> was used to identify deregulated pathways. The used gene sets and all statistics from GSEA are shown in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">17</ref>. It is noteworthy that GSEA independently confirmed the findings of IPA analysis using mutated genes from WES. Several aspects of GPCR signaling were found significantly enriched in EITL samples including GPCR ligand binding, signaling by GPCR and, importantly, G&#945; i signaling (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>). These clearly suggest a marked deregulation of G&#945; i signaling in EITL and further indicate the functional importance of discovered GNAI2 mutations.</p>
            <p>Primary EITL cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% human serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and 500 IU/ml interleukin-2 (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). To test the feasibility of targeted therapy in EITL, 5 &#215; 10 3 cells were seeded in 96-well plates in three technical replicates and treated with Stattic (CAS 19983-44-9; Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX, USA) and MEK inhibitor PD0325901 (CAS 391210-10-9; Axon Medchem, Groningen, The Netherlands) for 72 h, and Tofacitinib (CP 690550; Selleck Chemicals), Trametinib (GSK 1120212; Axon Medchem) and Gefitinib (ZD 1839; Axon Medchem) for 96 h at indicated concentrations. Cell viability was measured using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The efficacy of inhibitors was further evaluated by their effect on downstream targets using western blot. Cell lysates for PD0325901, Trametinib and Tofacitinib were collected 2 h and for Stattic 24 h posttreatment. Dose-response curves were plotted using the <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC4895162-software-100">Prism</rs> software (<rs type="publisher" corresp="#PMC4895162-software-100">GraphPad</rs>, La Jolla, CA, USA).

            <p>A T. vaginalis customized cDNA microarray (TvArray V2.0) was implemented by the Molecular Regulation and Bioinformatics Laboratory, Chang Gung University, Taiwan. The TvArray chip contained PCR products amplified from 7,688 EST clones with an average GC content of 38.36% and an average length of 384 bp. The cDNA inserts were fabricated on GAPS TM II Coated Slides (Corning. USA). The microarrays were prehybridized in Coplin chambers using a solution containing 1% bovine serum albumine, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 3X saline sodium citrate buffer (1X SSC consists of 0.15 M NaCl with 0.015 M sodium acetate). The slides were incubated at 50 C for 30 min, washed with water and isopropanol and dried by centrifugation at 90 &#194; g for 3 min. Hybridization with the cDNA hybridization mix and washes were performed following the protocol for the 3DNA Array 900 Expression Array Detection Kit (Genisphere). cDNA hybridizations were performed in a VersArray Hybridization Chamber (Bio-Rad) at 60 C overnight. Hybridizations with fluorescent 3DNA reagents were performed in the same chamber at 60 C for 4 h. After the final washing step, the slides were dried by centrifugation at 90 &#194; g for 3 min and scanned using the GenePix 4200A scanner (Axon). <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC3490414-software-100">GenePix Pro</rs> <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC3490414-software-100">5.1</rs> software was used to determine the average signal intensity and the local background for each spot.

            <p>Male Wistar rats weighing 220 -240 g and male C57BL/6J mice weighing 20 -25 g were from Centre Elevage Janvier, Le Genest-St. Isle, France. The animals had free access to tap water and standard food and were treated in accordance with European Community guidelines concerning care and use of laboratory animals. Glucose tolerance test. Gavages of conscious rats or mice with 1 g of glucose per kilogram of body weight were performed after a 16-h fast using a D-glucose solution without (control) or with RELM-&#9252;. The total bolus volume for mice and rats was 0.25 ml and 1 ml, respectively, and the amount of glucose in each bolus was adjusted for the animal weight. The recombinant murine RELM-&#9252; (18 kDa; PeproTech, Neuilly-sur-Seine, France) used was highly purified by high-performance liquid chromatography and was endotoxinfree. RELM-&#9252;, at a final concentration of 0.1 and 1 nmol/l, results in dose range of 0.01-0.1 g/kg of body weight. RELM-&#9252; is a stable molecule as high amounts of the homodimer form have been detected in mice and human stools <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(21)</ref>. Preliminary experiments showed that the peptide given by gavage was found in proximal small intestine after 5 min with a recovery of 70%. Before starting the OGTT, blood samples were taken from the tail and fasting blood glucose levels (milligram per deciliter) were determined (ACCU-CHEK; Roche Diagnostic, Meylan, France). The bleeds were further taken at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after oral glucose administration. These experiments were performed at least with 6 -10 individual animals. Tissue preparation and short-circuit measurement. Rats were fasted for 16 h and were killed by pentobarbital overdose. The proximal jejunum was dissected out and four adjacent samples were mounted in Ussing chambers as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(22)</ref>. The tissues were bathed with 4 ml of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) solution (pH 7.4) with 10 mmol/l glucose at 37&#176;C. In the solution bathing the mucosal side of the tissue, glucose was replaced by mannitol. Both solutions were gassed with 95% O 2 /5% CO 2 . Electrogenic ion transport was monitored continuously as short-circuit current (Isc) by using an automated voltage clamp apparatus (DVC 1000; WPI, Aston, England) linked through a MacLab 8 to a MacIntosh computer. KRB alone (vehicle) or containing RELM-&#9252; (0.001-1 nmol/l) was added in the mucosal bath 2 min before a glucose challenge. Carbachol (100 mmol/l) was added at the end of each experiment as a control. Further, similar tests were performed with RELM-&#9252; incubated overnight at 4&#176;C with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against RELM-&#9252;. Results were expressed as the intensity of the Isc (A/cm 2 ) or as the percentage of the peak Isc obtained after glucose challenge (measured after 3 min) over basal Isc (measured just before the addition of glucose). Transmural transport of hexoses. The experiments were performed using jejunal sacs from adult Wistar rats. Animals were fasted for 16 h and were killed by pentobarbital overdose. The proximal jejunum was dissected out and rinsed in cold saline solution. Jejunal loops (4 cm long) were prepared and 0.5 ml of KRB solution without (control) or with 1 nmol/l RELM-&#9252; was inserted inside the jejunal lumen. The jejunal loops were incubated for 15 min in oxygenized KRB at 37&#176;C and conditions were maintained during hexose transport assay. The corresponding jejunal loops were filled with 1 ml of KRB solution without (control) or with 1 nmol/l RELM-&#9252; and containing 0.02 Ci/ml of the isotopic tracer D-[1-14 C] glucose (49.5 mCi/mmol) and glucose to obtain a final concentration of 10, 30, and 100 mmol/l. Similarly, we studied the paracellular transport with 30 mmol/l mannitol and the isotopic tracer D-[1- <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref> C] mannitol (59 mCi/mmol) at 0.2 Ci/ml. All the jejunal loops were incubated in 10 ml of KRB solution during the indicated time. The radioactivity was measured in the collected samples of serosal KRB solution and used to calculate glucose or mannitol transport as picomoles per milligram of jejunal protein. Five independent experiments were performed and significance is expressed as *P &#1021; 0.05,**P &#1021; 0.01. Western blot analysis. Rats were anesthetized by pentobarbital and laparotomized for in situ experiments. Three jejunal segments (5 cm long) were tied and filled with 3 ml of KRB without (control) or with 1 nmol/l RELM-&#9252;. After 3 min of in situ incubation, 3 ml of 60 mmol/l glucose solution were injected in the lumen to obtain a final concentration of 30 mmol/l. After a further 3 min, these loops were removed and opened along the mesenteric border and the mucosa was scraped off on ice with a glass blade. Total cell protein extracts and BBMs were prepared from the scrapings as previously described ( <ref type="formula">23</ref>), and enrichment was estimated by determination of alkaline phosphatase activity (20-fold increase of activity in BBMs). Solubilized proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblot analysis. The following rabbit antibodies were used at a 1:1,000 dilution: SGLT-1 (AB 1352; Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), GLUT2, PKC &#9252;II (sc-9117, sc-210; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Tebu-Bio, France), phospho-AMPK-&#9251; (Thr172), AMPK-&#9251; (23A3), and phospho-PKC (pan (2531, 2603, 190D10; Cell Signaling Technology, Ozyme, France). The intensity of the specific immunoreactive bands was quantified using National Institutes of Health Image (Scion, Frederick, MD). Glucose uptake experiments. Uptake experiments were performed using rat intestinal everted rings as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(24)</ref>. Groups of eight intestinal rings were incubated at 37&#176;C for 15 min in oxygenized KRB buffer in the absence (control) and the presence of RELM-&#9252; (1 nmol/l) and cytochalasin B as indicated. Then the rings were incubated for 2 min in an uptake solution corresponding to a KRB buffer containing 30 mmol/l glucose and 0.1 Ci/ml of the isotopic tracer D-[1-14 C] glucose. After adding the uptake solution, the rings were washed in ice-cold KRB solution, and radioactivity incorporated in the tissue was quantified by liquid scintillation. Data were not corrected for extracellular substrate because RELM-&#9252; was found not to affect paracellular diffusion. Total protein from homogenized tissue with a Dounce homogenizer was determined with bicinchoninic acid reagent from Pierce (Thermo Scientific, Brebie `res, France). Results are expressed as micromoles glucose per gram of tissue protein. Chemicals. Recombinant murine RELM-&#9252; was purchased from PeproTech (Neuilly-sur-Seine, France). Antibody raised against RELM-&#9252; was a gift from Dr. Blagoy Blagoev (University of Southern Denmark). D-[1-14 C] Mannitol was from GE Healthcare Amersham Biosciences (les Ulis, France), D-[1-14 C] glucose was from Perkin Elmer (Boston, MA), and compound C from Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme-Chibret (Paris, France). All other chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Statistical analysis. All results were expressed as means &#1006; SE.

            <p>his study compared, by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the efficacy of three solvents on the removal of filling materials from dentinal tubules during endodontic retreatment. Forty human maxillary canines with straight canals were prepared according to a crown-down technique and enlarged to a#30 apical file size, before obturation with gutta-percha and a zinc-oxide-eugenol based sealer. The samples were stored for 3 months before being randomly assigned to four groups: chloroform (n=10), orange oil (n=10), eucalyptol (n=10) and control (n=10). Solvents were applied to a reservoir created on the coronal root third using Gates Glidden drills. The total time for retreatment using the solvents was 5 minutes per tooth. Following retreatment the roots were split longitudinally for SEM evaluation. SEM images were digitized, analyzed using <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC4327276-software-100">Image ProPlus</rs> <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC4327276-software-100">4.5</rs> software, and the number of dentinal tubules free of filling material from the middle and apical thirds was recorded. No significant difference was found among the solvent groups regarding the number of dentinal tubules free of root filling remnants in the middle and apical root thirds (p&gt;0.05). However, the control group had fewer dentinal tubules free of filling material (p&lt;0.05). Under the tested conditions, it may be concluded that there was no significant difference among the solvents used to obtain dentinal tubules free of filling material remnants.</p>

            <p>Rats were sacrificed by intracardial perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M of phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) under anesthesia. The maxillae were dissected and molar-bearing segments of alveolar bone were cut from each side and further fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde buffer. The specimens were decalcified in 10% ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid solution (pH 7.4) for 8 weeks, and further dehydrated in ascending concentrations of ethanol and embedded in paraffin. Serial 5-&#956;m-thick sections including the crestal areas mesial and distal to the maxillary molars were cut and mounted on L-poly-lysine-coated glass slides. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemistry was performed. For immunohistochemistry staining, endogenous peroxidase in the tissue section was blocked with 1% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes and then further blocked with 1% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 minutes. The primary antibody used was polyclonal rabbit anti-human ephrinB2. An immunohistochemistry staining kit (Maixin Bio, Fuzhou, China) was used for further staining. Finally, sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted. Negative controls were labeled using the same procedures, but omitting the incubation with primary antibodies.

            <p>Mouse smooth muscle cells (MOVAS) were cultured in DMEM media, with 10% FBS, 1% pen/strep, and 0.2 mg/ml G418 in 37 &#176;C 5% CO 2 incubator. Cells were seeded onto the cover-slip at an initial density of 10,000 cell/cm 2 then placed into 6-well plate for culture, or cells were seeded directly into the surface of the CellNO Trap. After overnight culturing to allow cell recovery, the specific NO donor was added by freshly dissolving donor stock solutions into the culture media to 2X specific concentrations and gently adding equal volume of this 2X donor media solution to the volume of culturing media containing cells. Immediately before using all the NO donors, the concentration of the different NO donor stocks were determined by UV-vis spectrometry. Then culturing of cells continued for different durations, with a 24 h maximum time frame. Immediately after the designated treatment time ended, proliferating cells were labeled by using EdU imaging kit. In brief, DNA synthesis was labeled by EdU (5-ethynyl-2&#8242;-deoxyuridine) incorporation, and this incorporation is visualized by alkyne-azide (EdU provides alkyne; Alexa Fluor s dye provides azide) reaction, which was performed after 3.7% formaldehyde fixation and 0.5% Triton X-100 permeabilization.

            <p>O bjective: This study evaluated experimentally-induced periapical bone loss sites using digital radiographic and histopathologic parameters. Material and Methods: Twentyseven Wistar rats were submitted to coronal opening of their mandibular right first molars. They were radiographed at 2, 15 and 30 days after the operative procedure by two digital radiographic storage phosphor plates (Digora &#174; ). The images were analyzed by creating a region of interest at the periapical region of each tooth (<rs type="software">ImageJ</rs>) and registering the corresponding pixel values. After the sacrifice, the specimens were submitted to microscopic analysis in order to confirm the pulpal and periapical status of the tooth. Results: There was significant statistically difference between the control and test sides in all the experimental periods regarding the pixel values (two-way ANOVA; p&lt;0.05). Conclusions: The microscopic analysis proved that a periapical disease development occurred during the experimental periods with an evolution from pulpal necrosis to periapical bone resorption.</p>

            <p>CycE induces E2F activity in proliferating and reversibly quiescent cells by preventing the formation of Rbf-E2F repressive complexes. However, our previous results indicated that CycE activity could not prevent repression of E2F target genes after cell cycle exit in terminally differentiated eye and wing cells . Rbf-E2F2-mediated repression is somehow resistant to G1 cyclin-Cdks despite G1 cyclin-Cdk phosphorylation of Rbf <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Frolov et al., 2003)</ref>. This makes E2F2 complexes prime candidates as factors limiting CycE-dependent activation of E2F after cell cycle exit in differentiated cells. Genetic studies of E2F2 have failed to demonstrate a role for E2F2 in cell cycle exit upon differentiation in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Frolov et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Weng et al., 2003)</ref>. e2f2 mutant cells exit from the wing and eye. Levels of GFP-E2F1 were determined by detection of the GFP tag using an anti-GFP antibody and compared between GFP-E2F1 WT and GFP-E2F1 PIP3A (Fig. <ref type="figure">1, F-H</ref>). We found that levels of GFP-E2F1 PIP3A in the presence of CycE-Cdk2 after To test whether CycE-Cdk2 activity affected degradation of E2F1 after cell cycle exit in a PIP box-dependent manner, we generated clones coexpressing either WT GFP-E2F1 WT or E2F with a mutated PIP box, GFP-E2F1 PIP3A with CycE-Cdk2 in the Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Degradation of E2F1 activator complexes and a switch to E2F2 repressor complexes contributes to the CycE-Cdk2-resistant repression of E2F activity after exit. Clones overexpressing CycE-Cdk2 and negatively marked by CD2 (A and B) were generated using hs-FLP act&gt;Gal4/UAS in e2f2 76Q1/G5.1 mutant wings. E2F transcriptional activity was monitored at the indicated stages using the PCNA-GFP reporter (A&#57401; and B&#57401;). CycE-Cdk2 activity is temporarily able to activate the E2F reporter in the absence of e2f2 (A) but is unable to sustain E2F activity after 40 h APF (B). (C-E) GFP-marked e2f2-null mutant clones expressing CycE-Cdk2 were generated using the MARCM system and examined for ectopic mitoses by staining for PH3. Neurons are marked by expression of Elav. Ectopic mitoses in e2f2 &#57394;/&#57394; cells expressing CycE-Cdk2 are evident in Elav-negative cells in eyes from 24 to 40 h APF (36 h APF shown; C) but are no longer observed by 44 h APF (D). No ectopic mitoses are observed in e2f2 &#57394;/&#57394; cells expressing CycE-Cdk2 in wings after 36 h APF (E). (F-H) Clones expressing either GFP-E2F1 WT or GFP-E2F1 PIP3A with CycE-Cdk2 were generated using hs-FLP act&gt;Gal4/UAS in pupal wings (F-H) and eyes (H). Clones were negatively marked by CD2 (F and G), and levels of GFP-tagged E2F1 were compared at 44 h APF. All GFP measurements were acquired at the same gain and at roughly similar tissue sections. Several samples (n = 7) across three independent experiments were compared for GFP intensity using <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC2886355-software-100">ImageJ</rs> (<rs type="publisher" corresp="#PMC2886355-software-100">National Institutes of Health</rs>), and representative examples are shown. Bars in H indicate the mean GFP intensity across all samples measured, and error bars indicate the standard deviation. GFP-E2F1 WT is destabilized in the presence of CycE-Cdk2 after exit in eyes and wings (F-H). Wings expressing either GFP-E2F1 WT or GFP-E2F1 PIP3A in the dorsal domain during pupal stages (under control of ap-Gal4/UAS, tub-Gal80 TS ) were assayed for PH3.

            <p>Assessment of tumor burden in the kidneys of mice was performed as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref>. Mouse kidneys were fixed in 10% buffered formalin saline (Thermo Scientific, Runcorn, UK) for 24 hours. Fixed kidneys were processed and paraffin embedded according to standard procedures. A series of 5-&#956;m coronal kidney sections was prepared at 200-&#956;m intervals from each kidney. Kidney sections were hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained and scanned to create virtual HE slides using an Aperio system (http://www.aperio. com/?gclid = CNXN-8by4a UCFcINfAods3eg1w). Virtual slides were used for lesion quantification. Maximum cross-sectional whole area and cellular area of each renal lesion were measured, respectively, using <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC5238457-software-100">ImageJ</rs> (<rs type="url" corresp="#PMC5238457-software-100">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij</rs>). Cellular areas of renal lesions were obtained from parenchyma and stroma. To estimate average size of tumor cells, cysts and papillary and solid tumors on HE-stained kidney sections were randomly chosen using <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs>. Average size of tumor cells was determined from parenchyma (not stroma) through total area of all tumor cells divided by the number of tumor cells examined. Analysis was conducted blindly with respect to treatment status.</p>
            <p>Wilcoxon rank-sum test was performed for comparisons of treatment efficacy on mouse renal lesions. Fisher's exact test was used to assess massive cell death in mouse solid tumors. P b .05 was considered to be statistically significant. Analyses were performed using <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC5238457-software-101">STATA</rs> <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC5238457-software-101">13</rs>.</p>

            <p>Combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) (30) for genome-wide LINE-1s (COBRALINE1) and COBRA for unique L1 sequences (CU-L1) were both performed as previously described, with some modifications (4). LINE-1s were selected by blat using L1.2 sequence to http://genome.ucsc.edu and full-length intronic LINE-1s with the representative COBRALINE-1 CpG dinucleotides were selected. All selected LINE-1s are listed in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>. After extraction, all DNA samples were treated with sodium bisulfite as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31)</ref>. Briefly, genomic DNA was denatured in 0.22 M NaOH for 10 min at 378C. Thirty microliters of 10 mM hydroquinone and 520 ml of 3 M sodium bisulfite were both added for 16-20 h at 508C. The DNA was purified and incubated in 0.33 M NaOH for 5 min at 258C, ethanol-precipitated, then washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in 20 ml of TE buffer. Two microliters of bisulfited DNA were subjected to 35 cycles of PCR with two primers, as listed in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>, at an annealing temperature of 538C. The amplicons were digested in 30 ml reaction volumes with 2 U of TaqI or 8 U of TasI in 1 &#194; TaqI buffer (MBI Fermentas) overnight at 658C and then electrophoresed on 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The intensities of DNA fragments were measured on a PhosphoImager, using the <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC2553567-software-100">ImageQuant</rs> software (<rs type="publisher" corresp="#PMC2553567-software-100">Molecular Dynamics</rs>, GE Healthcare, Slough, UK). The TaqI positive methylated amplicons yielded 80-bp DNA fragments, whereas the TasI positive unmethylated amplicons resulted in 98-bp fragments (previously reported as 97 bp). The LINE-1 methylation level was calculated as a percentage (the intensity of the TaqI-digested methylated LINE-1 fragment divided by the sum of the TasI-digested unmethylated LINE-1 and TaqI-positive amplicons). For CU-L1, several other methylated and unmethylated digested amplicons, as listed in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>, were also measured. The methylation levels among several CpG dinucleotides were compared. All COBRA assays were performed in duplicate. The same set of DNAs was applied as positive controls in each set of the COBRA experiments. The PCR products of some of the CU-L1 were cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Santhan, UK) and sequenced.</p>

The XhoI and NotI restriction endonuclease sites incorporated into the sense and antisense primers above are shown in boldface. After PCR amplification, the amplicon was double digested with XhoI/ NotI for 2 hours following the manufacturer's protocol. The PCR product was subsequently subcloned into the XhoI/NotI sites downstream of the Renilla luciferase (r-luc) reporter gene (psiCHECK-2; Promega). The authenticity and orientation of the inserts relative to the Renilla luciferase gene were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. The resulting recombinant plasmids were designated psiCHECK/CDK6-UTR. Finally, transformed bacterial cultures were grown and each reporter construct was purified the PureLink Hipure Plasmid Maxiprep kit (Invitrogen).</p>

            <p>Step 3 and calculate the most likely model. A schematic of our algorithm appears in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>. For a total number of G windows of size n c with &#945; &#8722; &#946; events per window, we must compute the criterion value a number of times that is roughly of the order Gn c (&#945; &#8722; &#946; ). If we set N = 100,000, I = 50, G = 1000, n c = 100, and &#945; &#8722; &#946; = 5, we get that a nested algorithm requires NI = 5 &#215; 10 6 calculations, whereas our method requires Gn c (&#945; &#8722; &#946; ) = 5 &#215; 10 5 calculations. In other words, our approach reduces computational requirements by an order of magnitude. In reality, because photobleaching is an exponential process, the vast majority of windows especially toward the end of the trace will have few or no events. Therefore Step 3 will either not need to be used or will have to discriminate between very few candidate models for those windows, so our approach is even faster than this upper bound. For typical photobleaching time traces with up to 10 3 data points, our algorithm works in seconds. For data sets that have between 1000 and 10,000 data points our algorithm runs in seconds to a few minutes. For very large data sets, our algorithm works faster than other methods we have tested. For example, in a test of a very large data set that was specifically designed to be hard to fit, performed on an ordinary MacBook Pro 2.5 GHz laptop, the Tdetector2 algorithm, which is based on Student's twosample t test as implemented in <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Chen et al. (2014)</ref>, required &#8764;7 d to run the 5 &#215; 10 4 -data point data set with 50 steps; our method needed 17 h.</p>
            <p>We benchmark our approach on synthetic data, demonstrating its applicability and limitations, and subsequently apply it to real experimental data. Our algorithm is implemented in a simple, freely available <rs type="software">Python code</rs> on the corresponding author's website.</p>

Thus, we digitally registered bright field images of the pial vasculature with the corresponding two-photon microangiographies. We then followed the arterial or venous vascular trees until they branched into capillaries and digitally pseudocolored them. For threedimensional reconstructions of the Texas-Red-dextran labeled cerebral vasculature, we intensity adjusted the z-stacks, Fourier filtered, and visualized them using maximum intensity projections. We restricted image analysis to averaging subsequent images with calculation of the mean and the s.d. for each pixel, and normalizing the 12-bit pixel intensities of the Fluoview1000 images to a continuous gray-intensity scale ranging from 0 to 1.</p>

            <p>As an alternative, our likelihood-evaluation algorithm checks whether the candidate parameter vector implies nonsensical steady-state values or the wrong number of unstable roots and returns a large negative likelihood value in these cases. This approach introduces discontinuities in the likelihood function, which can create difficulties for some gradient-based algorithms. There are two kinds of difficulties. Some algorithms may try to take a gradient of the objective function at points where the function value is worse than that at the beginning of the iteration. If such a point happens to be in the region where the objective function is flat at a large negative value because of nonexistence of equilibrium, this obviously creates a problem. Other routines attempt sophisticated line searches that interpolate polynomials across function values obtained in the line search. When the function is discontinuous, these methods may not only fail to be useful, they may also fail to find an improved value even when a less sophisticated line search would easily find it. Our routine that avoids these difficulties is available as a Matlab m-file.</p>
            <p>We have found a way to double the accuracy of <rs type="software">Matlab</rs>'s <rs type="publisher" subtype="person" corresp="#10.1086%2F654239-software-100">Ricatti</rs> equation solver <rs type="software" xml:id="10.1086%2F654239-software-100">lyap.m</rs> by essentially applying it twice. We have truncated the triangular orthogonalization generated by the block Levinson algorithm at a fixed lag length in every function evaluation. At some stages of our work, we used a Bayesian hill-climbing algorithm that can be adjusted to make it insensitive to modest levels of rounding error in likelihood evaluation. And finally we have used the likelihood conditioned on the data being at "steady state" at a distant past point, as described in the text. A separate paper or papers describing these numerical innovations is in preparation.</p>

            <p>Predictions are performed using an ensemble of three SVM classifiers that are designated to predict all disordered residues (SVM ALL ), and disordered residues in long (&#8805;30 residues) (SVM LONG ) and short segments (&lt;30 residues) (SVM SHORT ). Each classifier is designed individually, i.e. uses different parameters and different set of input features (see Sections 2.5 and 2.6) computed from the <rs type="software">IUPred</rs>, <rs type="software">DISOclust</rs> and <rs type="software">DISOPRED2</rs> predictions, the sequence, the sequence profiles and the various relevant sequence-based predictions. The latter predictions are performed using methods chosen based on two criteria: (i) their quality is comparable to the leading relevant predictors; and (ii) they provide a stand-alone implementation that could be utilized to build an autonomous implementation of the proposed disorder predictor. We utilize <rs type="software">PSIPRED</rs> <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(McGuffin et al., 2000)</ref> for the SS prediction, <rs type="software">Real-SPINE3</rs> for the prediction of the relative solvent accessibility (RSA) and backbone dihedral torsion angles <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Faraggi et al., 2009)</ref>, <rs type="software">PROFbval</rs> for the B-factor prediction and residue flexibility prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Schlessinger et al., 2006)</ref> and <rs type="software">RPSP</rs> for the signal peptide prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Plewczynski et al., 2008)</ref>. We also use <rs type="software">IUPred</rs> to predict globular domains. The selection of the SVM as the classifiers was motivated by its prior extensive use in disorder prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hirose et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kinoshita 2007, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Peng et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shimizu et al., 2007a, b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Vullo, et al. 2006)</ref>. We use a linear-kernel-based SVM introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fan et al. (2008)</ref>. The real-valued prediction is computed as a maximum among the probabilities generated by SVM ALL , SVM SHORT and SVM LONG (we combine all predicted disordered residues) and the resulting value is binarized using the threshold that equals 0.37. The value of the threshold was found using the MxD dataset. We 'smooth out' our binary predictions by filtering out short segments (&#8804;2 residues). On the first pass, we convert predicted ordered residues in segments &#8804;2 residues to disordered residues with probability of 0.37. One the second pass, we reassign the short, &#8804;2 residues, segments of disordered residues as ordered with probability of 0.369. The MFDp predictor is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.</p>
            <p>We utilize a sliding window of size 15 centered over the predicted residue to extract the features. We use the raw numerical values for each of the 15 positions, which include: the probability of the prediction of disordered residues from <rs type="software">IUPREDL</rs>, <rs type="software">IUPREDS</rs>, <rs type="software">DISOPRED2</rs> and <rs type="software">DISOclust</rs>; the PSSM values; the probabilities of prediction of helix, coil and strand conformations from <rs type="software">PSIPRED</rs>; the predicted B-factor values; the predicted solvent accessibility and backbone angles; and the binary values denoting whether a given position in the window is predicted as a signal peptide, i491  belongs to a globular domain, is part of a purification tag or is predicted as flexible by <rs type="software">PROFbval</rs>, to encode the features. We also aggregate the raw numerical values (except for the predicted backbone angles) by computing averages in the sliding widows of sizes between 3 and 41, and by taking maximal and minimal value in the sliding widows of sizes between 3 and 15. The averages for the residue at the i-th position in the sequence are computed as follows:</p>

            <p>GO is a hierarchical graph-based annotation system where the terms closer to the root describe more general information while those away from the root provide more specific information about a given GO category. The root (level 0) describes three main GO categories at level 1, which are "biological process", "molecular function" and "cellular component". We used GO terms only from the "biological process" and "molecular function" categories because the data for the "cellular component" category are very sparse. Ideally, we would have used GO terms that provide specific descriptions on the processes or functions; however, the more specific the terms get, the less frequent they are, which prohibits meaningful comparison of GO term frequencies across different cancer. Hence, we chose the GO terms at level 4 for our analysis because at this level, GO terms are more specific (than those at previous levels), while generic enough to cover broader groups of related processes or functions to attain reasonable cumulative frequency for analysis. All the GO terms associated with a protein sequence were obtained from the GO database as graph paths, which have an inherent hierarchical order starting from the root (level 0). Since our goal is to compare the number of common GO terms across different cancer types, these GO terms must be selected at the same level in the graph path (for all cancers) to make the comparison meaningful. We developed a <rs type="software">Perl program</rs> to store all the graph paths for a given protein. Using this program, under each GO category (except the "cellular component"), the common GO terms for a given pair of PPIs were determined at level 4 to calculate the frequency of common GO terms in a given cancer. Since the size of PPI dataset (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) varies across different cancer types, frequencies of common GO terms were normalized against the number of PPIs, showing at least one common GO term in each cancer dataset. This normalization ensures a fair comparison of the common GO term frequencies across different cancer types irrespective of the size of PPI datasets used. The top 20 most frequent common terms were selected from each cancer, which were combined to obtain a nonredundant set of GO terms under the biological process and the molecular function categories, respectively.</p>
            <p>We created a comprehensive, non-redundant dataset of human interacting protein pairs (PPIs) by combining experimentally derived datasets from five major protein interaction databases, including DIP (Database of Interacting Proteins; http://dip.doembi.ucla.edu), IntAct (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact), BIND (Biomolecular Interaction Network Database; http://www.bind.ca), HPRD (Human Protein Reference Database; http://www.hprd.org) and MINT (Molecular Interaction Database; http://mint.bio. uniroma2.it/mint). Protein sequences in each of these databases are fairly overlapping, but are indexed by different identifiers such as SwissProt/UniProt identifier, GenBank protein identifier, etc, making it difficult to identify redundant sequences. To remove redundancy, we first created datasets of unique sequences (based on full-length protein sequence string comparison using <rs type="software">Perl scripts</rs>) within each database and then merged them to create a non-redundant dataset of interacting protein sequences, each indexed with our internal identifier. Note that this internal identifier can be used to map all the original source identifiers for corresponding sequences in the source databases. Finally, we obtained 27,051 unique human protein sequences (henceforth referred to as P int ) representing 57,307 unique PPIs. The FASTA formatted protein sequences and PPI datasets for each cancer used in this study can be downloaded at http://bioinformatics.albany.edu/gpb/.</p>
            <p>To map the interacting proteins with corresponding differentially expressed genes, we performed a BLAST search against the P int dataset described above using very stringent criteria as following. For each query protein, the top hits with a sequence identity of &#8805; 95% and a sequence length match between 90%-110% were selected. Functional annotations for the selected interacting proteins were obtained from the GO database (http://www.geneontology.org). We developed several <rs type="software">Perl scripts</rs> to analyze the most frequent common GO terms in PPIs belonging to individual cancer types.</p>

            <p>At the outset of this discussion it is important to explore in detail the role of detrending in the empirical analysis. As noted in section 3, several authors have documented the sensitivity of the results from estimating unconstrained VARs to the assumptions about trends. At the same time, previous studies have virtually ignored the fact that the trends are determined both by the specification of the underlying uncertainty in the economy and the structure of the economic model itself. Therefore, 6. Standard errors of all variance decompositions reported in this paper were computed using the Monte Carlo procedure described in the <rs type="software">RATS</rs> manual, page 17-3. Let b denote the estimated VAR coefficient vector and let V denote the estimated covariance matrix of the residuals in the VAR. Suppose that the VAR disturbances are i.i.d. and normally distributed. Then the posterior distribution of (b,V) is Normal-Wishart (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zellner (1971)</ref>). Two hundred draws were taken from this distribution and the variance decomposition of the 48-month-ahead forecast error implied by each draw was calculated. The reported standard error is the square root of the sample variance of the estimated variance decompositions from the two hundred simulations.</p>

            <p>Data were recorded and entered into a REDCap database and analyzed by data management personnel for completeness and accuracy. All critical variables had a 100% check for accuracy of entry. The patient demographics were compared between the LVEF groups: EF &#8805;55%, EF 35% to 54%, and EF &lt;35%. Comparisons between the different LV EF groups based on the Holter study findings were performed using combined Holter results for each patient. Tests of differences in proportions were made by Fischer's exact test or other v 2 test. Continuous variables were tested for normality. Comparisons of means or medians were made using 1-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis, respectively. Analyses for the composite outcome of (1) significant Holter finding and (2) change in care were performed using the variables: age, LVEF, RVEF, LV dilation, presence of LGE, steroid medications, carvedilol, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor-I, angiotensin receptor blocker, Aldactone (spironolactone), frequent premature atrial contractions, frequent ventricular contractions, nonsustained atrial tachycardia, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Logistic regression with backward elimination was used, and variables with P-value &lt;0.05 were included in the final model.</p>

            <p>The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias was applied to assess methodological quality and detect potential sources of bias. The scale of Jadad (10) was used to quantify the quality of included studies; this scale assesses randomization, blinding and description of withdrawals. Relevant data on study design, including patients, interventions and reported outcome measurements were recorded on an extraction form designed for this review by two reviewers. Disagreements were settled by consensus. Following agreement, the data were entered into <rs type="software">Review Manager</rs> Software.</p>
            <p>We performed meta-analysis using <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC4898839-software-100">Review Manager</rs> Software (version <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC4898839-software-100">5</rs>) for outcome measures when the heterogeneity of data was not significant. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic, which describes the variability in effect estimate across studies that is due to differences between studies rather than random sampling error. Heterogeneity was deemed substantial if the I 2 analysis suggested more than 50 percent of the variability in an analysis was due to differences between trials. In such outcome measures we did qualitative analysis (0).We used random effect model for meta-analysis. The Mantel-Haenszel method was used for dichotomous outcomes and the Inverse Variance method for continuous outcomes.</p>

Direct MTA targets could be of higher impact than the indirect signaling pathway in question. Oncogenes' alterations because of their impact on inducing cancer could be considered more deleterious than TSG alterations and consequently considered of higher impact in treatment algorithms. For example, when a tumor sample from a patient enrolled in a PM trial harbors an activating mutation of BRAF (V600E) and a homozygous deletion in PTEN, the inhibition of BRAF using vemurafenib should be considered of higher priority as compared with the use of an AKT or an mTOR inhibitor. An important criterion in prioritizing molecular alterations is also the presence of downstream resistance biomarkers. These data  review should be considered together with technical issues and thresholds (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">5</ref>).</p>

            <p>However, odds and OR, ratio of odds in exposed and unexposed group, can be easily obtained in this design. When the disease is very rare, we can use OR as an approximation of RR. Also different size of no disease group is applicable as the study design is needed. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the value of RR can be easily changed by only arbitrarily changing the size of no disease group from 1.91 to 1.98, while OR shows consistency having the same value of 2.

All continuous variables are described as the mean&#177;standard deviation. Analysis of normality was firstly performed. Variables with a skewed distribution were log-transformed for further analysis. Student t test and one-way analysis of variance were used to compare the mean values of continuous variables. The chi-square test and the chi-square test for trends were used to compare categorical variables between groups. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to identify determinants for age at diagnosis and serum C-peptide at diagnosis, respectively. Univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression analyses were undertaken to evaluate predictors for whether or not C-peptide levels were preserved (&#8805;0.6 ng/mL). In all analysis, the statistical significance was defined as less than 0.05 of P-values.</p>

We thank an anonymous referee for this suggestion. 5. Adding an indicator for home ownership did not improve the fit. 6. We thank two anonymous referees for making these points. Regarding the second point, the referee suggests distinguishing between homeowners who bought at or near the peak from those who bought much earlier. This is a very good idea that unfortunately does not work out. The HRS does contain data on respondent reported year of home purchase, but, less than 20 percent of the sample owned their 2006 home fewer than eight years and less than 12 percent owned it fewer than five years. 7. According to the Schwarz Criterion, this restriction works better than allowing the effect of home equity to vary over the Great Recession years. 8. The third specification is presented to demonstrate that our Great Recession equity variable does better than some alternatives. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Deng, Quigley, and van Order (2000)</ref> use a negative equity specification. If the present value of future mortgage payments exceeds the value of the home, the household may default. For this to occur, the household will have to have bought the home shortly before 2007. Given the percentages in note 6, it is unlikely that a negative equity specification will produce significant results. 9. The observed significance level for the office worker result is .053.</p>

            <p>An IV approach is another way to deal with the problem of omitted variables. We will instrument county-level unemployment rates with observable features in the labor market while leaving out the residuals including any unobserved components. Compared to the fixed-effects model, the IV approach allows us to keep using parts of the cross-county variation that are clearly driven by labor-market fluctuations. Specifically, we calculate the time series of likely employment losses 3. We switch to linear models in order to take advantage of <rs type="software">STATA</rs>'s built-in command to handle large dummyvariable sets (about 3000 counties in our case). The choice is also motivated by the incidental parameters problem that renders fixed effects probit models inconsistent. The choice of linear vs probit models makes little qualitative difference in SWB regressions, as documented in Ferrer-i- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Carbonell and Frijters (2004)</ref>. However, it does mean that the estimates in Tables <ref type="table">S7 and S8</ref> for the fixed effects models are not strictly comparable to those from the probit models. The income equivalents in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, on the other hand, are comparable as they are expressed as income equivalents (or ratios of coefficients). Ratios of coefficients are robust to the choice of probit or linear models, because switching from one to the other tends to affect estimated coefficients proportionally (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Helliwell and Huang 2009)</ref>. for individual counties based on their shares of employment by industry and external statewide employment losses by industry. We then use the contemporaneous and lagged likely losses to instrument for local unemployment rates in standard two-stage regressions. This approach leaves out unobserved local characteristics except for those that are correlated with local compositions of industries or with statewide loss of employment by industries, the only two pieces of information used in the IV approach. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> We implement the IV approach using the industry classification at the level of 11 supersectors defined in the BLS. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The current likely loss and its 3-year lags, namely LikelyLossRate j,s,t &#8722; k for k = 0, 4, 8, 12, are then used as instruments in a two-stage least squares IV regressions. These likely employment losses are strong predictors of county-level unemployment rates: even without any co-variates, the likely losses explain 42% of the variation in the county-level unemployment rates since 2005.</p>

            <p>The <rs type="software">ELECTRE-TRI</rs> based offers' scoring system cannot be used the same way, since it does not operate on the options rating. It does not allow to score any offer until the full package is not created, therefore, negotiators cannot observe in details the direct trade-offs between the different resolution levels of issues. The graph of history cannot be depicted for the offers scored by <rs type="software">ELECTRE-TRI</rs> either, since the scores are in fact the ranges that correspond to the actual sub-category but not the scalar values. Instead of the classic history graph a simple general map can be drawn showing the pace of concession in terms of moving from one sub-category to another. Negotiation support system may also have implemented the optimization engines that allow them to act pro-actively in the actual negotiation phase, like some heuristics or game theory models. These engines may determine the fair solutions and suggest negotiators the alternative offers as the agreement proposals, like in <rs type="software">Smartsettle</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Thiessen and Soberg 2003)</ref>.</p>

            <p>Propensity scores were calculated employing probit regression using the "<rs type="software">teffectpsmatch</rs>" package in the <rs type="software" xml:id="10.1556%2F032.2017.67.3.2-software-100">Stata</rs> <rs type="version" corresp="#10.1556%2F032.2017.67.3.2-software-100">13</rs> software. First, we calculated the score based on the full sample with 477 observations. Then, the trimmed sample was employed, after eliminating countries that never participated in IMF programmes during the observed period. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the output of our regression, where pseudo R 2 for regression comprised 0.51, 0.52, and 0.31 for Models 1, 2, and 3. The third model represents regression based on the trimmed sample. The models precisely predict 71%, 74%, and 75% of IMF participation, respectively, based on calculated propensity scores. We use blockid in the specification to split the sample into blocks based on scores, which are 6 and 5, respectively, for the full and the trimmed samples. The balancing property was automatically run and has been satisfied, which means that in each of these blocks, not only the propensity scores were similar, but also the covariates on which we match. Before discussing the correlation of the obtained coefficients with our treatment variable, it must be noted that the common support option has been selected. The common support condition is valid, as countries with the same features cannot be observed in both the treated and the control group. The regions of common support are (0.012, 0.976) and (0.025, 0.961) for the full and the trimmed samples, respectively. Thus, the requirement on common support has been ensured, which, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Heckman et al. (1997)</ref>, is a major source of biased propensity score assessment. In order to check the overlap assumption, the distributions of propensity scores for full and trimmed samples have been plotted. It is revealed that there were no substantial differences between the distributions and that they were spread asymmetrically within the control and the treated groups. The slight inclination towards the rump in the trimmed sample illustrates that countries in the treatment group were more likely to resort to the IMF. To complete the checks, the kernel density of propensity scores has been estimated based on the Epanechnikov function with 0.023 bandwidth, where the graph revealed that the measured propensities, namely that an under-programme country would be under-programme and a non-programme country would not participate in IMF programmes, were in the area of coincidence.</p>

            <p>The dimensions of our panel data set (T &#188; 17 and n &#188; 105) suggest the potential presence of cross-sectional dependence in the data. To check whether fixed effects or random effects are suitable for our analysis, we perform the Hausman test, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hoechle (2007)</ref>, which takes into account the possibility of cross-sectional dependence in our data. This test is a slightly modified version of the panel-robust version of the Hausman test suggested by <ref type="bibr">Wooldridge (2002, p. 288ff</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hoechle's (2007)</ref> adaptation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Wooldridge's (2002)</ref> test is robust to very general forms of spatial and temporal dependence in the residuals. In addition to the "modified standard Hausman test," we also undertake two further tests, respectively a test for the presence of heteroskedasticity and one for serial correlation in the residuals. If the Hausman test rejects the random effects in favor of the fixed effects, and if our residuals are heteroskedastic and serially correlated, then we estimate model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) with fixed effects by simultaneously taking into account the possibility of heteroskedasticity, serial correlation, and cross-sectional dependence in the residuals. In other words, we estimate a fixed-effects (within) regression model with Driscoll and Kraay <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> (1998) standard errors (henceforth referred to as FE-DK), which <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hoechle (2007)</ref> adapted in <rs type="software">Stata</rs> for unbalanced panels.</p>

            <p>1. The literature uses the terms participation and employment interchangeably. We use the term employment to indicate that a mother is working and female labor force participation (FLFP) to indicate aggregate participation in the labor market including unemployment. 2. While the initial database construction was done by the authors, a student assistant checked through most of the papers in our database to correct any remaining errors in elasticity, sample size, and sample year variables following the guidelines in . The authors resolved coding differences that arose during the check by referring to the primary studies and subsequent studies that cited these primary studies. 3. We estimate the WLS regressions using the aweight routine in <rs type="software">Stata</rs>. Since we proxy the standard error using the square root of the sample size, the sample size is used as the proxy for the inverse variance. 4. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Michalopoulos and Robins (2000)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Michalopoulos and Robins (2002)</ref> use both Canadian and American data.

We additionally tried to control for estimates from samples of married or single women separately but the results are contradictory and no discernible pattern emerges. Studies that include both single and married women are largely made up of married women.</p>

            <p>Parameters with a normal distribution, as assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk test, are expressed as meanAESD. Parameters with a skewed distribution, such as PTX3, hs-CRP, tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin-6, and BNP levels, as well as E/e' and LVMI, are shown as median values (interquartile range) and were logarithmically transformed before linear regression analysis. Differences between continuous variables were analyzed by the unpaired t test and the Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate. Differences between categorical variables were analyzed by the chi-square test. Linear regression analysis was used to determine the associations between PTX3 and BNP levels, LVMI, inflammatory makers, and cardiovascular events. Survival data were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and assessed by the log-rank test. Age-and sex-adjusted event rates were calculated by multivariable logistic regression analyses. The ability of any marker to predict cardiovascular events was assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. In Cox proportional hazards regression analyses, associations between groups and all other parameters were first analyzed by univariate analysis followed by multivariable analysis after adjustment for factors that were significant with univariate analysis. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were also performed using forced inclusion models. Model 1 incorporated the inflammatory makers PTX3, hs-CRP, tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin-6, and BNP. Model 2 incorporated the 5 prognostic factors (PF5) that were identified during the I-PRESERVE study 10 in patients with HFNEF-age, presence of diabetes mellitus, previous hospitalization for HF, New York Heart Association classification, and LVEF-as well as BNP and PTX3. Model 3 incorporated PF5, BNP, and hs-CRP. Model 4 incorporated PF5, BNP, hs-CRP, and PTX3. Estimates of the C-statistic for Cox proportional hazards regression models were calculated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> Cstatistics were estimated after PTX3 and BNP levels were added to PF5. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> The proportional hazards assumption was confirmed by the Schoenfeld global test. Calibration of Cox regression models was also performed by the Gr&#248;nnesby and Borgan calibration test. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> The incremental effects of addition of PTX3 to PF5 and BNP levels to predict future cardiovascular events were evaluated using the net classification index (NRI), as previously described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> Patients were stratified into 1 of 3 risk categories based on PF5 and BNP levels measured during the mean 30-month follow-up period: low risk (0% to &lt;10%), intermediate risk (10% to 20%), or high risk (&gt;20%). PTX3 was subsequently used to reclassify the risk category for ascertaining whether there would be improvement in the NRI. The NRI was calculated using the following equation: NRI=([number of events reclassified as higher&#192;number of events reclassified as lower]/number of events)&#192;([number of nonevents reclassified as lower&#192;number of nonevents reclassified as higher]/ number of nonevents). A P value &lt;0.05 was considered significant.

            <p>This is a descriptive-analytic case-control study. The study was approved by Institutional Review Board of Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences (AJUMS). Four health centers in Ahvaz were selected by random sampling in 2009. Staff members of these health centers collaborated in data collection and a medical student collected questionnaire from these health centers. Because of low prevalence of non-BF mothers, at first, all non-BF mothers (78 non-BF mothers) attending health centers were requested to participate in the study and then 78 BF mothers participated through random sampling and their consent was acquired orally. We tried to consider similarity in other variables such as some risk factors of PPD (21) between the two groups. Exclusive BF is defined as the feeding of breast milk only, and no other liquids or solids with the exception of drops or syrups consisting of vitamins, minerals supplements, or medicines <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. This method was assumed for at least six months (6) for the BF group, and they were reassessedfour months later for continuation of BF. Mothers who discontinued BF due to precautions for taking medications were excluded. Participants were asked to complete demographic and obstetric data questionnaires and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Demographic and obstetric data questionnaires contained maternal age, employment history, educational level, economic status, previous history of depression or PPD, previous history of abortion or still birth, type of delivery, gender of infant, number of previous pregnancies, infant gender satisfaction, pregnancy satisfaction, and reason for BF cessation. The EPDS is a 10-item self-report scale for measuring the intensity of depressive symptoms experienced within the past 7 days. Each statement is rated on a scale from 0 to 3 ("yes, most of the time" to "no, not at all"), total score ranging from 0 to 30. Seven of the 10 items are scored reversely <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. The cut-off score for indication of PPD is 12/13 or greater <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>. For the first time, Cox et al. designed EPDS as a screening tool for the secondary prevention of PPD (30) with established validity and reliability. A cut-off score of 13 or greater identified probable postnatal depression with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 78% <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>. The best cut-off point in Iranian sample is 12/13 with sensitivity of 95.3% and specificity of 87/9% <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>, which can be used 6-8 weeks after delivery to screen for PPD <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. We used EPDS with cut-off of 12 and translated it to Farsi. Data were analyzed using the <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC3428639-software-100">Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)</rs> windows version <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC3428639-software-100">13.0</rs>. Results were calculated as frequencies (%), means and standard deviations. Groups' comparisons were done by chi-square test and odds ratio (95% confidence interval) and t-test. A probability of P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

The time when the concentration fell to half of C max , T half-max , was calculated based on linear interpolation from the mean concentration profiles. The area under the concentration-time curve to the last measurable concentration, AUC last , was estimated by the linear trapezoidal rule. The AUC inf was calculated as AUC last &#254; C last /k e , where C last is the last measurable plasma concentration and k e is the terminal rate constant. The half-life was calculated as ln(2)/k e . Clearance uncorrected for bioavailability of loxapine (CL/F) was calculated as total dose/AUC inf .

            <p>The <rs type="software">pssRNAMiner</rs> improves a previously described method of evaluating the P-value of random hypergeometric distribution to detect phased small RNA clusters <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref>. First, <rs type="software">pssRNAMiner</rs> maps the input small RNAs on transcript sequences and records each position. Then, as described by Chen et al. <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref>, the algorithm slides on both strands of the transcript sequence to search each mapped small RNA and count the number of phased/nonphased positions with small RNA hits in a 231 bp region downstream of the 5 0 start site of the small RNA. Equations <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and (2), revised from Chen et al. <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref>, are used to calculate the P-value of phased small RNA clusters on the basis of a random hypergeometric distribution. Since the cleavage of phased small RNAs often occurs within 1-2 nt of the phased positions (8), we introduced a variable, s, in Equation (1) to reflect this shift. The addition of this variable will have the added effect of reducing the total number of nonphased position within the 231 bp region.</p>

Whole blood was also collected into PAXgene Blood RNA tubes (PreAnalytiX, Hombrechticon, Switzerland) from three males, derived from different litters, of each strain. Briefly, total RNA isolated from these four tissue sources was reverse-transcribed with an Oligo(dT)-T7 primer (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and double-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized with the GeneChip Expression 3 0 -Amplification One-cycle kit (Affymetrix). In an in vitro transcription reaction with T7 RNA polymerase, the cDNA was linearly amplified and labeled with biotinylated nucleotides (Affymetrix). A total of 10 mg of biotin-labeled and fragmented cRNA was then hybridized onto Rat Genome 230 2.0 GeneChip arrays (Affymetrix) for 16 h at 45 1C. Post-hybridization staining and washing were performed according to the manufacturer's protocols using the Fluidics Station 450 instrument (Affymetrix). Finally, the arrays were scanned with a GeneChip Scanner 3000 laser confocal slide scanner.</p>

            <p>In biosciences, as well as in other natural sciences, we are often faced with situations that have been referred to as uncomfortable science, a term attributed to statistician John Tukey, in which the little available data are used both in the inference model and the confirmatory data analysis. The resulting overoptimistic 'confirmatory' results are often referred to as 'systematic bias'. Similarly, 'information leak' from data to methods can occur from improper and repeated cross-validation. In the general case, information leak results from developing or training an algorithm based on the entire available data set so that the test set is not independent. In some cases, the leak can occur subtly and inadvertently such as when a very similar sample is present both in training and test set. A better-known effect is 'overfitting', in which a model is developed with superior accuracy on its training data at the cost of reduced generalization of the model to new data sets. A notable example of this effect can be found in the Note that we did not find any self-assessment paper where the presented method was not top ranked in at least one metric or data set. The survey was conducted over a large pool of scientific peer-reviewed papers selected as follows. First, a <rs type="software">Google Scholar</rs> search using the keywords 'computational biology method assessment' was conducted. When papers with comparisons of methods were identified, we further examined (1) papers from the same journal issue and</p>

            <p>Google Scholar is a multidisciplinary search engine which shares common features with other search engines such as Elsevier's Scirus and bibliographic databases such as WoS and Scopus (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>). It was launched in 2004 by Google as a free web-based search engine. Over the past few years, it has substantially expanded its indexing of full texts of journal articles and books due to the agreements with Elsevier and other big and small publishers, online libraries, and repositories (for example, In-gentaConnect &#174; ). The search engine also covers patents, confer- ence proceedings, theses, presentations, web-pages, newspapers, and other non-peer-reviewed sources.  <rs type="software">Google Scholar</rs> has gained a place in basic or back-up literature search algorithms for its comprehensive coverage of information across multiple disciplines, publishing formats and languages, as well for its simplistic approach to literature searches <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Searches through <rs type="software">Google Scholar</rs> are not linked to an organised vocabulary of scholarly keywords, and therefore do not require expert searching skills. The indexed sources, including web pages, are tagged with web-based keywords, which are found in the titles, abstracts, or full-texts of journal, book, and website articles.</p>
            <p>Though  <rs type="software">Google Scholar</rs>'s indexing criteria and list of covered periodicals have not been publicised, it is well known that the chances of being indexed and retrieved through the search engine increase with increasing citations and web links to the scholarly articles and web-pages of the periodicals. The more an item is cited and downloaded, the higher its rank in the  <rs type="software">Google Scholar</rs>'s ranking algorithm.</p>
            <p>Similar to WoS and Scopus,  <rs type="software">Google Scholar</rs> has a 'cited by' function to track citations of the indexed sources and calculate the h index for individual researchers. Journal citation counts in Google Scholar substantially outnumber those in WoS and Scopus <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(17)</ref> and constitute important indicators for small journals from non-Anglophone countries, where a large proportion of citations come from local and non-English journals, PhD theses, and books <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(18)</ref>. Unlike WoS and Scopus, no journal performance indicator, similar to JIF or SJR, is calculated by  <rs type="software">Google Scholar</rs>.</p>

            <p>Preparation of CIK cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from peripheral blood by standard Ficoll separation, as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Human peripheral blood samples were obtained with full informed consent from patients with HCC. In total, six samples were collected between January 2014 and July 2014 at the Department of Gastroenterology of Renmin Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine (Shiyan, China). The isolated cells were resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 1,000 U/ml interferon (IFN)-&#947; (R&amp;D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) and incubated at 37&#730;C for 24 h. Then, recombinant human interleukin (IL)-2 protein (cat. no. 202-IL-050; R&amp;D Systems, Inc.) and mouse anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)3 monoclonal antibody (cat. no. MAB100; dilution, 1:1,000; R&amp;D Systems, Inc.) were added at 500 U/ml and 50 ng/ml, respectively. Subsequently, the cells were refreshed with RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with IL-2 (500 U/ml) every other day for 10 days prior to being subjected to flow cytometry analysis.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> CIK cells were harvested and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen, China), and resuspended in 100 &#181;l PBS/BSA.

            <p>Computational methodology. Geometries of the neutral ground state and radical cations were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory, followed by single-point calculations employing the valence-triple-&#950; 6-311 + G(d,p) basis set <ref type="bibr">35,36,51,52</ref> for faster convergence as implemented in the <rs type="software">Q-Chem</rs> software package <ref type="bibr">37</ref> . The reorganization energies, shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, are calculated based on the usual four-point scheme <ref type="bibr">22</ref> neglecting the outer sphere contributions to the total reorganization energy.</p>
            <p>An X-ray diffraction pattern from crystals of compound 2 was collected at the Stanford Syncrotron Radiation Lightsource, at beamline 11-3 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S4</ref>). The unit cell structure was obtained by a least-square fitting method (<rs type="software">homemade software</rs> employing a modified Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm) using the positions of 15 clearly measurable, overlap-free peaks in powder spectrum. The unit cell dimension is slightly smaller than the predicted one, similar as the case for compound 1 noted earlier. Using the experimental crystal structure, we re-calculated the transfer integrals and found much stronger coupling along the a-axis; V P increased from 0.0415 to 0.0687 eV whereas V T1 and V T2 are the same. Thus, the transfer integrals suggest that mobility along a-axis would be highest; we expect only a moderate anisotropy in the mobility in the ab-plane as all three transfer integrals are reasonably high. Ensuing calculated mobility of 3.36 cm 2 V &#8722; 1 s &#8722; 1 for the crystal is only slightly higher than the predicted value of 3.34 cm 2 V &#8722; 1 s &#8722; 1 .</p>

            <p>It is used to understand the Cash pooling of MCC the main objective of this paper a Delphi Technique <ref type="bibr">(Linstone, Turoff 1975)</ref> in which the basic was the common understanding of the financial experts of the corporation around a subject; the Cash pooling. It is shown in the table 1 (See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) to a most important descriptive variables around the research study; the Research Sheet of the empirical analysis of this pa per. It has been necessary 3 rounds to get a Unique Model based on the very similar ideas of the Financial and Treasury Directors of the MCC (past and present ones). This technique has been using with the help of a Crossimpact Matrix 1 to a better explanation of the relationship of variables relate to Cash pooling and using the quantitative matrix to a more objecti ve representation of the correlation between variables. It has been used 15 hours and interviews were fully recorded and transcribed. Content analysis was carried out using <rs type="software">Nvivo10</rs> software: going regularly from theory to fieldwork and back, allowed the codification, the organization into a hierarchy and the theorization of collected data, more particularly finding and including the concept of organizational routines. Moreover it is necessary to take into consideration that MCC is growing into the internationalization and globa lization processes because as the conventional companies it is the aim of the companies to expand their product and services and create value in a global sense. It is necessary into the international economy to the survival of companies <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(SanJose et al. 2013)</ref>. But, most of the Mondragon multi nationals are market-seeking, in the early days of the inter nationalisation process, and some of them are obliged to follow their big manufacturing clients abroad as suppliers. There are other motives for the internationalization, for example the low production costs; primarily through cheap and wellmotivated unskilled or semiskilled labour. "If the MCC cooperatives are to compete against large industrial multinationals, they must develop their own multinational production and distribution networks" <ref type="bibr">(Errasti et al. 2003: 559)</ref>. However, although its interest and relative influence the internationalization it is not the aim of this paper.</p>

The tested cell line conditions were plated in 3 ml medium in six-well plates at the density required to obtain 70-80% cell confluence at the end of the experiment. Twenty-four hours later for QGP-1 cell line conditions and 72 h later for BON-1 cell line conditions, medium was replaced and cells were incubated for 72 h with vehicle. One-step reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed on total RNA from six biological replicates in a single reaction using the Power SYBR Green RNA-To-CT 1-Step kit (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) on a LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany). Primers were designed using <rs type="software">QuantPrime</rs> software <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Arvidsson et al, 2008)</ref> and RTPrimerDB (http:// www.rtprimerdb.org) and have been obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Leuven, Belgium) (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). All reactions have been performed in triplicates in 384-well plates with 2 ml total RNA (prediluted to 15 ng ml &#192; 1 ) as input in a total reaction volume of 10 ml, further comprising 5 ml Power SYBR Green RT-PCR Mix (2 &#194; ; Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.08 ml RT Enzyme Mix (125 &#194; ; Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 200 nM of each primer (final concentration).</p>

            <p>Introduction: People in tropical and semi-tropical areas are in danger of scorpion sting, and this can be a serious problem for them. Mortality due to scorpion sting in the tropical and semi-tropical areas of Iran is about 75%, and this makes scorpion sting in these areas a serious medical problem. Because of this problem, our aim was to assess the epidemiological aspects of scorpion sting in Bandar Abbas, Iran, during 2009-2011. Methods: In this cross-sectional retrospective study, epidemiologic data of 698 scorpion sting cases, who were referred to the Shahid Mohamadi Hospital of Bandar Abbas in Hormozgan Province collected from 2009 until 2011. The data included demographic and individual information, such as age, gender, geographic location, bite site, when the incident occurred, and anti-venom consumption. The required data were extracted from the patients' recorded information in the Hospital, and we recorded data in a special checklist and imported the data into the computer for statistical analysis using of <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC4886572-software-100">SPSS</rs> software, version <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC4886572-software-100">21.0</rs>. Descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation, frequency, and percentage, were used for data analysis. Results: Two hundred and sixty-one (37.4%) of the cases were urban and 437(62.6%) were rural. Males comprised 50.1% of the cases, and women comprised 49.9% (p &gt;0.05). Twenty-five point two percent of scorpion sting cases occurred among people in the 21 to 30 age group, and there were very few cases among people in the 51 to 60 age range (p&lt;0.05). Most of cases were recorded in April and October, and the fewest cases were recorded in July and January (p&lt;0.05); also 32.2% of scorpion sting cases occurred after midnight and in the early morning hours. Conclusion: Our survey showed that there was a high incidence of scorpion stings in rural areas, among 21-30 age group, among housekeepers, and among students. These results indicate the need for public education programs and better sanitation services in the rural areas around Bandar Abbas city. Prospective studies can help to health and medicine organization for prevention and treatment of scorpion sting.</p>

With commercially available software (<rs type="software">Radi Medical Systems</rs>, Uppslae, Sweden), the shaft of the pressure wire can act as a proximal thermistor, sensor near the tip of the wire simultaneously measured the pressure and temperature acting as a distal thermistor. Thermodilution technique was used to check the the transit time of room temperature when saline was injected down to coronary arteries (8). 3 mL aliquots of room temperature saline was administered to the coronary artery, and the resting mean transit time (baseline mean transit time [bTmn]) was measured. Steady state of maximal hyperemia was induced by intravenous infusion of adenosine (140 &#181;g/kg/min). Three additional 3 mL aliquots of room temperature saline was injected, and the hyperemic mean transit time (hTmn) was measured. The simultaneous measurements of mean aortic pressure (Pa, by guiding catheter) and mean distal coronary pressure (Pd, by pressure wire) were also obtained during the resting state and maximal hyperemic state. The CFR thermo was calculated, dividing the resting hTmn by the bTmn. The IMR was defined as the simultaneously measured distal coronary pressure divided by the inverse of the hTmn <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>.</p>

            <p>EMLA cream (lidocaine 2.5% and prilocaine 2.5%) and oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg up to a maximum of 15 mg were given as premedication. Anesthesia was induced with intravenous agents, thiopentone or propofol. In cases with difficult venous access, sevoflurane inhalation was used. All patients were intubated using a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane or sevoflurane, nitrous oxide and oxygen, and mechanical ventilation. At the end of surgery, the residual paralysis was reversed with atropine and neostigmine. The choice of intraoperative and postoperative analgesics was at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist. Pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure, electrocardiography, core temperature, end tidal carbon dioxide, and anesthetic concentrations were monitored. Normothermia and normocapnia were maintained. The anesthetic depth was adjusted clinically by the attending anesthesiologist. The Bispectral Index (BIS), not revealed to the anesthesiologists, was continuously monitored and recorded using the A-2000 BIS monitoring system (Aspect Medical Systems, Inc., Newton, MA) and a standard adult (Zipprep) electrode. All the parameters monitored were downloaded using software developed in our department. Any episode of desaturation (SpO 2 90% for 30 s or more) or hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt;80 mm Hg for 3 min) after excluding the effect of artifacts, were recorded for data analysis. Pain scores on the first day after surgery and at 6 weeks were recorded using the visual analog scores (VAS). The pain levels were categorized as mild (VAS 5-44 mm), moderate (VAS 45-74 mm), and severe (VAS ! 75 mm). <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> </p>

            <p>For mass spectrometry analysis of the Fc, a plasmin digest was performed. For the digest, 100 mg of all five samples were dialyzed using slide-a-lyzers into 50 mM Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, pH 8.0, at 4 C overnight. Subsequently, 0.1 units plasmin (1.05 U plasmin/mg Protein, Roche Diagnostics) were added to each sample and incubated at 25 C for 72 h. After the digest, plasmin-treated samples (50 mg) were deglycosylated by adding 0.5 mL N-glycanase plus (Roche Diagnostics) and sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.1) to obtain a final sample volume of 115 mL. The mixture was incubated at 37 C for 18 h. For denaturing, 100 mL of 6 M Gua&#162;HCl (Pierce) were added. The mixture was incubated at 37 C for 30 min. Samples were desalted by SEC (Sepharose G-25, isocratic, 40% acetonitrile with 2% formic acid). ESI mass spectra (Cve) were recorded on a Q-TOF instrument (maXis, Bruker) equipped with a nano ESI source (TriVersa NanoMate, Advion). MS parameter settings were as follows: Transfer: Funnel RF, 400 Vpp; ISCID Energy, 0 eV; Multipole RF, 400 Vpp; Quadrupole: Ion Energy, 4.0 eV; Low Mass, 600 m/z; Source: Dry Gas, 8 L/min; Dry Gas Temperature, 160 C; Collision Cell: Collision Energy, 10 eV; Collision RF: 2000 Vpp; Ion Cooler: Ion Cooler RF, 300 Vpp; Transfer Time: 120 ms; Pre Puls Storage, 10 ms; scan range m/z 600 to 2000. Software (<rs type="software">MassAnalyzer</rs>) developed in-house was used for data evaluation.</p>

            <p>A total of 151 apparently healthy pet store animals including 108 rodents, 39 rabbits and four sugar gliders were examined for the prevalence of Yersinia spp. (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Animal stool samples were collected from 13 pet stores (store nos. A to M) in the Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, between September 2012 and November 2014. The samples were stored at 4&#176;C for up to five days prior to being sent to our laboratory. Approximately 2 g of each stool sample was suspended in 20 ml of Yersinia enrichment broth according to Ossmer (Mer-ck, Darmstadt, Germany) or 20 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS). These suspensions were incubated at 32&#176;C for 24 hr and at 4&#176;C for 3 weeks, respectively. Following incubation, each of the enrichment broths was streaked (with or without KOH treatment) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> onto Yersinia selective agar supplemented with cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin (Oxoid Ltd., Hampshire, U.K.) and MacConkey agar (Oxoid Ltd.). The plates were incubated at 32&#176;C for 20 hr and at 25&#176;C for 48 hr, respectively. Following incubation, suspected colonies were selected and cultured on Columbia Blood Agar (Oxoid Ltd.) plates containing 5% sheep blood. Identification of the bacteria was performed as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The O serogroup of the isolates was determined by slide agglutination test using commercial antisera (Denka Seiken Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The biotype of the isolates was determined as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> using API 20E (BioM&#233;rieux, Tokyo, Japan), API 50CH (BioM&#233;rieux) and API ZYME (BioM&#233;rieux). The pathogenicity of the isolates was confirmed by PCR targeting the virulence genes, yadA, ail and virF <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis was performed as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> using the NotI restriction enzyme (Roche Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan) and CHEF-MAPPER system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, U.S.A.) with a switching time of 5 to 8 sec for 19.5 hr at 14&#176;C.

            <p>Hans Rosling, a professor of international health in Sweden, delivers a wonderful lecture on global trends in health, demography, and economics. The talk is intrinsically interesting. For example, he points out that the world has made a transition over recent decades from being divided into two groups, long life/small family and short life/large family, into a world where most countries outside of Africa have long lives and small families. But especially striking is that <rs type="publisher" subtype="person" corresp="#10.1257%2Fjep.21.1.237-software-100">Rosling</rs> has founded a nonprofit software provider called <rs type="software" xml:id="10.1257%2Fjep.21.1.237-software-100">Gapminder</rs> to provide vivid moving illustrations of how countries' health and economic statistics evolve over time. Recorded February 2006. Rosling's presentation is available at the Technology Entertainment Design website at &#855;http:// www.ted.com/tedtalks/tedtalksplayer.cfm?key&#1005;hans_rosling&#856;.

Set the appropriate values of the SEM imaging parameters HV (20 kV), aperture (120 &#181;m), high current mode ON, scan speed (e.g., 5), magnification (e.g., 3,000) and noise reduction (pixel average). 3. Focus the electron beam on the sample surface at WD in the range between 12 and 22 mm. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">4</ref>. Switch off the electron beam acceleration voltage and close the column chamber valve. 5. Turn on the power supply for the EBSD detector. Move the EBSD detector from parking position to measuring position in the SEM chamber. 6. Open the column chamber valve and switch on the electron beam acceleration voltage. Re-focus the electron beam on a region of interest on the sample surface. 7. Open the <rs type="software">EBSD control software</rs> and load the calibration file for the chosen WD. 8. Set up the measurement in the <rs type="software">EBSD control software</rs> according to the operating manual. 9. Perform the background acquisition according to the EBSD operating manual. 10. Read out the position of the EBSD pattern center and the detector distance for the chosen WD from the <rs type="software">EBSD control software</rs>. 11. Focus the electron beam in a region of the sample adjacent to the region of interest for the actual measurements. Leave the beam to scan there for about 1 hr for stabilization. 12. Check the amount of beam drift which must not exceed more than 1 &#181;m during the whole EBSD measurement. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">13</ref>. Navigate the electron beam to the region of interest and re-focus. 14. Schedule line scans parallel to the tilt axis in the region of interest. Use the beam mapping (not stage mapping) setting.

Be sure to select "save all images". Disable indexing to speed up the measurement. 16. Run the line scans until the last scan is finished. 17. Switch off the electron beam acceleration voltage and close the column chamber valve. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">18</ref>. Retract the EBSD detector from the measuring position to park position and turn off the EBSD control unit. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">19</ref>. Vent the chamber, remove the sample and evacuate.</p>
            <p>2. Choose an appropriate EBSD pattern that will act as the reference pattern from a measuring point that should be located in a specimen area absent of strains. 3. Apply at least 15 widely distributed regions of interest on the pattern. 4. Use the coordinates of the pattern center and the detector distance which were determined by the <rs type="software">EBSD control software</rs> for the further evaluation. 5. Enter the rest of the parameters relevant for the evaluation, i.e., elastic constants of the analyzed material, number of steps in the line scan and step size, detector size and its resolution in pixels, detector and specimen tilt angles as well as the detector binning. 6. Use a band pass filter during the calculation of the 2-dimensional Fourier transformation (inner filter of 6 pixels and outer filter of 40 pixels). 7. Run the evaluation program. 8. Read out the numerical results from the evaluation text file "protocol.txt" using a conventional spreadsheet program when the calculation is finished.</p>

For both the lumen and the media-adventitia interface, automatic border detection was performed at the predefined lesion segment and manual correction was subsequently performed and required the agreement of two independent, experienced cardiologists. Disagreements were reviewed by a third cardiologist. After confirming the border detection, the software automatically calculated and displayed the results. For each frame, histologic findings were expressed in colors (green for fibrous, green-yellow for fibro-fatty, white for dense calcified, and red for necrotic core area). The predictive accuracy of this method with tissue mapping has been validated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13)</ref> The area (mm 2 ) and percent area of each tissue component of plaque were analyzed at the minimal luminal area site, and the volume (mm 3 ) and percent volume of each tissue component of plaque were evaluated within the full segment of the culprit lesion.

            <p>To validate potential HPC markers expressed in liver tissue, the same antibodies (except for ALB, because albumin is co-expressed in hepatocytes and HPCs) used for immunocytochemistry were used to detect the localization of HPCs in human liver tissue. Liver segments (1 to 2 g) were fixed with formalin and embedded in paraffin before sectioning. The sections (5-&#956;m thick) were applied to poly-L-lysine-coated slides. Following an inactivation of endogenous peroxidases with 3% H 2 O 2 for 10 min at RT, the sections were incubated overnight with primary antibodies (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>). Control experiments included omission of the primary antibodies and substitution of the primary antibodies with nonimmune rabbit or mouse IgG. Subsequently, the sections were washed with PBS three times and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies at 37&#176;C for 1 hr. After the reaction with DAB Chromogen, the sections were rinsed with distilled water, counterstained with hematoxylin, and mounted with Histomount solution (Invitrogen), and the labeled cells were visualized with an inverted microscope (Nikon, Eclipse E200, Tokyo, Japan), and digital images were captured using <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC3880993-software-100">Nis-elements F</rs> <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC3880993-software-100">3.0</rs> software.

The theoretical cross sectional areas can be calculated from the crystal structure coordinates using the <rs type="software">MOBCAL</rs> <ref type="bibr">15,16</ref> software, which is an open source FORTRAN based software allowing code editing according to the operator needs. For running such calculations it is required to modify the program such that the number of iterative calculations performed per input structure is increased and that coordinate files containing large number of atoms are accepted</p>

All data from continuous variables such as age, BMI, daily calorie intake, household income, and AUDIT are presented as the mean and standard errors (SEs), which were calculated using a complex samples plan for descriptive analysis. Data from categorical variables such as smoking status, physical activity, SES (income, occupational, and educational status), marital status, and cancer screening are presented as the percentage and SEs. Chi-square tests were used to compare percentages for cancer screening within two years according to SES.

Data collecting and handling were carried out using dedicated software (<rs type="software">Spectacle</rs>; TSP).

The voltage applied was 17.5 kV, and ultraviolet (UV) detection was performed at 254 nm for adenine nucleotides or 200 nm for PCr. The capillary was thermostatically maintained at 25&#176;C. The separation buffer used in all experiments was sodium tetraborate (20 mM) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (1 mM), adjusted to pH 9.2. The spatial area of each peak was calculated by integrating the area of the migration time. For each standard, the area under the curve was plotted against the concentration injected and calibration curves were constructed. From the spatial area of each peak on the electropherogram of each heart sample extract, the concentration of each substance was determined from the calibration curves.</p>

            <p>All nl-reactors recovered after thermocycling were added to the COPAS sample cup and analyzed. Both, object diameter (based on extinction) as well as fluorescence intensity (510 nm) of each nl-reactor, were measured concomitantly by pulse shape analysis (<rs type="software">COPAS profiler</rs> software). First, the system was calibrated by analyzing 300 nl-reactors in order to set an adaptive fluorescence intensity threshold just above the main, non-fluorescent, population, which was evaluated to be at 780 AU (at 510 nm). Next, gates for a ToF value of 600-1000 AU were applied for dispensing of nL-reactors into a 96-well microtiter plate. For sampling of the control group, the same ToF gates were applied and 48 putatively PCR-negative nl-reactors featuring signal intensities below the adaptive threshold (600-780 AU) were sorted out. All samples were immediately processed further in order to recover the plasmids (see next section).</p>

Those patients who had an AUC change (ratio) as a result of drug substitution of less than 0.67 or greater than 1.5 were considered to be in potential danger due to the substitution. We found that less than 6% of patients fell outside of the cutoff range of 0.67-1.5 as a result of original to generic substitution. However, in the case of generic to generic substitution, the proportion was as high as 9-12%. This alerts us to the potential danger of generic substitution, especially for drugs with narrow therapeutic indices.</p>

            <p>All qPCR experiments were performed on an ABI 7000 sequence detection apparatus (Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France) using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix as described by Mbe &#180;guie &#180;-A-Mbe &#180;guie &#180;et al. (2008b). Two micrograms of total RNA extracted from different banana fruit tissues and organs treated with RQ1 DNase (Promega, Charbonnie `res, France) to remove possible contaminating genomic DNA were used. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from these RNA using AMV reverse transcriptase enzymes (Promega, Charbonnie `res, France) and random hexamers according to the manufacturer's instructions. To hamper the effect of putative PCR inhibitors that might be present in the reverse transcriptase reaction, as well as pipetting errors, the cDNA was 10-fold diluted with distilled water, and 5 ll of the diluted cDNA was used as a template for qPCR analysis. The qPCR program included one cycle of 5 min at 94 &#176;C for template denaturation and Taq activation, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 94 &#176;C for template denaturation, 15 s at 50 &#176;C for primer annealing, and 30 s at 72 &#176;C for primer elongation. Fluorescence was analysed using <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC2682500-software-100">Sequence Detection Software</rs> (<rs type="publisher" corresp="#PMC2682500-software-100">Applied Biosystems</rs> Courtaboeuf, France).

            <p>Statistical analyses. To assess the prognostic value of age and sex, we conducted the analyses in the following three steps. First, we used the cumulative incidence function (CIF) to estimate the crude effect of age and sex on RCSM and OCM. Second, the Fine and Gray competing risks regression models were used to examine the effect of sex on cause-specific mortalities stratified by age groups after adjusting for possible confounds. The subdistribution hazard ratios (SHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed, with SHR less than 1.00 indicating reduced mortality. Finally, we analyzed the joint effect of age and sex on RCSM. We also assessed the effect required of a hypothetical unmeasured binary factor to explain the observed SHR of sex using sensitivity analysis. All the analyses were stratified by localized disease and regional/distant disease, because OCM makes a substantial contribution to deaths in localized disease, whereas RCSM accounts for the majority of deaths in regional/ distant disease. All statistical analyses were performed with R software using the packages <rs type="software">cmprsk</rs>, <rs type="software">survival</rs> and <rs type="software">riskRegression</rs> <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> .

The H-2K b cDNA (gift from F. Momburg, DKFZ) was inserted into pcDNA3.1. The myc-tagged human GIM AP1 and GIM AP5 inserted in pCANmyc1 were gifts from G. Butcher (The Babraham Institute, Cambridge, England, UK). A plasmid for GFP-2OP in vitro transcription was generated using eGFP cloned in pcDNA/Zeo, as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Wenger et al., 2012)</ref>. 4 &#215; 10 6 DCs were transfected with 20 &#181;g mRNA using the mouse DC nucleofection kit (Amaxa). Total mRNA was purified using the RNeasy Mini kit (QIA GEN), and cDNAs were synthesized by SuperScript II system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers' instruction. Mouse and human Rufy4 cDNA was amplified by nested-PCR using cDNA from MoDCs as template and then cloned to pcDNA3.1 vector with tagging with Flag (C terminus), myc (N terminus), or mCherry (N terminus). The &#916;RUN and &#916;FY VE domain mutants were obtained by PCR. Human WIPI2 cDNA was also cloned from human MoDC cDNA by conventional PCR method and then fused to the GFP gene at its N terminus in the pcDNA3.1 vector. The plasmid DNAs were introduced to the cell lines with use of JetPrime regent (Polyplus). ONE-TAR GET plus siRNA targeting Rufy4 and ONE-TAR GETING plus nontargeting siRNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used as specific Rufy4 siRNA and as control siRNA, respectively. 4 &#215; 10 6 IL-4-treated bmDCs were transfected at day 4 with 5 &#181;M siRNA using the Nucleofector (Amaxa) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were collected 48 h after transfection and analyzed. qPCR Total RNAs were extracted and purified using the RNeasy Mini kit. 100 ng to 1 &#181;g total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using Super-Script II.

            <p>Western blotting. Protein samples were prepared from cultured cells for Western blot analyses. These samples were homogenized in cell lysis buffer [25 mM Tris HCl pH 7.6, and 2% SDS] by sonication and denatured in the presence of 100 mM dithiothreitol (Wako Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) at 85uC for 5 min. In parallel, the protein concentrations were determined using a micro-BCA kit (Protein Assay Reagent; Pierce/Thermo Scientific). Typically, 20 mg of protein was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Advantec, Tokyo, Japan). The membrane was probed with anti-ErbB1 (Eptomics Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA), anti-ErbB2 (Eptomics Inc.), anti-ErbB3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), anti-ErbB4 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), or anti-phospho ErbB2 or anti-phospho ErbB3 antibodies (Cell Signaling; Eptomics Inc.). We used fresh blotting membranes to detect total and phosphorylated ErbB2 proteins as the conventional stripping procedure did not allow us to reuse the membrane that had been treated with the antiphospho ErbB2 antibodies (data not shown). A blotting membrane was also probed with the anti-Sulf-1 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). After extensive washing, the immunoreactivity of the membrane was detected with a horseradish peroxidaseconjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin followed by a chemiluminescence reaction (ECL kit, GE Healthcare Japan Co., Tokyo, Japan or Immuno Star LD, Wako Chemical, Tokyo, Japan). The intensity of an immunoreactive band, whose size matched the authentic molecular weight, was measured by a CCD camera and an image processing software, <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC3590560-software-100">GENETOOLS</rs> (<rs type="publisher" corresp="#PMC3590560-software-100">Syngene</rs>, Cambridge, UK).

            <p>Two experiments were conducted in 2013-2014. Potato plants were grown in 15 cm diameter pots filled with soil in a greenhouse until they were 30-35 cm tall. For each cultivar, five plants of equal size were transferred to a growing chamber (16 h, 23&#176;C day; 8 h, 15&#176;C night; light intensity above the canopy 4 000 lux). The RWC (fresh weight -dry weight)/(turgid weight -dry weight) &#215; 100 <ref type="bibr">(Pieczynski et al. 2013</ref>) was evaluated before the drought treatment (control; turgid plants) and after 3 weeks without watering (drought). Results were expressed as RWC after 3 weeks without watering in relation to the control according to the formula: (RWC of plants after drought treatment) &#215; 100%/ (RWC of control plants) and calculated as an average from the 2 years.

            <p>Systematic evaluation of nurses' competence and its related factors are essential for enhancing the quality of nursing care. This study aimed to assess the nurses' competence level and its possible relationship with their personality and emotional intelligence. Methods: Using a cross-sectional survey design, three instruments including Nurse Competence Scale, short form of Schutte Self Report Emotional Intelligence Test, and the short 10-item version of Big Five Factor Inventory, were administered simultaneously to a randomized stratified sample of 220 nurses working in hospitals affiliated to Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. Data analysis was performed using <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC4923836-software-101">SPSS</rs> <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC4923836-software-101">11.5</rs>. Results: Majority of nurses rated themselves as "good" and "very good", with the highest scores in "managing situations" and "work role" dimensions of nurse competence. A relatively similar pattern of scores was seen in competence dimensions, personality and emotional intelligence, among male and female nurses. Emotional intelligence and personality scores showed a significant relationship with nurses' competence, explaining almost 20% of variations in nurse competence scores.</p>

            <p>Investigating our electronic patient records (Eyeswide), patients with neovascular AMD treated with intravitreal injections of 0.5mg/0.05ml ranibizumab were identified and their notes reviewed. The evidence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) was confirmed by fluorescein angiography. Patients were treated with ranibizumab following the PrONTO regime <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>. After a loading dose of three injections, criteria for further anti-VEGF injections were; detection of any intraretinal, subretinal fluid, serous pigment epithelium detachment, haemorrhage or drop in vision. Patients were followed up monthly and by OCT regardless whether they received an injection or not until six months after the last injection. The patient's baseline characteristics are shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.OCT scans (Cirrus&#8482; HD-OCT 400, Software 4.0, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Germany) of these patients' were reviewed by two trained observers. Macular edema was classified as either predominant intraretinal fluid (IRF), subretinal fluid (SRF) or as predominant pigment epithelium detachment (PED). In addition, intraretinal fluid was differentiated in cystoid type (cyst diameter &gt; 150 um) and spongiod type (cyst diameter &lt; 150 um).</p>

            <p>We note that the economics literature now abounds with interesting, relevant <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">5</ref> The plot for the probability model was produced by first fitting a probit model of the binary variable GRADE as a function of GPA. This produces a functional relationship of the form Prob(GRADE &#1005; 1) &#1005; &#9021;(&#9251; &#1001; &#9252;GRADE), where estimates of &#9251; and &#9252; are produced by maximum likelihood techniques. The graph is produced by plotting the standard normal CDF, &#9021;(&#9251; &#1001; &#9252;GRADE) for the values of GRADE in the sample, which range between 2.0 and 4.0, then connecting the dots. The nonparametric regression, although intuitively appealing because it can be viewed as making use of weighted relative frequencies, is computationally more complicated. Today the binomial probit model can be fit with just about any statistical package, but software for nonparametric estimation is less common. <rs type="software" xml:id="10.1257%2Fjep.15.4.169-software-100">LIMDEP</rs> version <rs type="version" corresp="#10.1257%2Fjep.15.4.169-software-100">8.0</rs>, produced by <rs type="publisher" corresp="#10.1257%2Fjep.15.4.169-software-100">Econometric Software, Inc.</rs>, was used for both the probit and nonparametric estimations. The nonparametric approach is based on the assumption that there is some as yet unknown functional relationship between the Prob(GRADE &#1005; 1) and the independent variable, GPA, say Prob(Grade &#1005; 1 | GPA) &#1005; F(GPA). The probit model based on the normal distribution is one functional candidate, but the normality assumption is more specific than we need at this point. We proceed to use the data to find an approximation to this function. The form of the "estimator" of this function is F(GPA*) &#1005; &#9018; i&#1005;all observations w(GPA* &#1002; GPA i )GRADE i .The weights, w(.), are positive weight functions that sum to 1.0, so for any specific value GPA*, the approximation is a weighted average of the values of GRADE. The weights in the function are based on the desired value of GPA, that is GPA*, as well as all the data. The nature of the computation is such that if there is a positive relationship between GPA and GRADE &#1005; 1, then as GPA* gets larger, the larger weights in the average shown above will tend to be associated with the larger values of GRADE. (Because GRADE is zeros and ones, this means that for larger values of GPA*, the weights associated with the observations on GRADE that equal one will generally be larger than those associated with the zeros.) The specific form of these weights is as follows:</p>

Patients were followed until July 5, 2013. The rates of removal due to transplant were computed, and homogeneity across regions in the rates was tested using a Pearson's chi-squared test. The rates were also computed conditional on the exception application status. Independence between RRB decision and removal for transplantation was assessed using a chisquared test for both the overall sample and within each region, and odds ratios comparing approved and denied patients were computed. P-values for the within-region tests were corrected using the Holm-Bonferroni method. A likelihood ratio test was used to assess the regional variation in the effect of application status on the odds of receiving transplantation. Mortality rates for exception approved and denied patients were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier estimate; the difference in survival between the groups was assessed using the log-rank test. The hazard ratio for denied vs. approved patients was estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model. Patients with Removal Code 8 in the OPTN database (indicating removal due to death) were recorded as having had the event; survival times for all other removal codes were treated as censored. The analyses were performed using the statistical software <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC5008171-software-100">R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing</rs>, version <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC5008171-software-100">3.1.1</rs>.</p>

The CIs were computed by Bayesian calculation. The effect of ageing in the most prevalent IF was assessed by means of a Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (r). We also stratified participants into three different groups according to their age (between 45 and 54, between 55 and 64 and between 65 and 75). IF's prevalence per sex and age group was also quantified. The &#967; 2 test was used to assess for statistically significant differences in each most prevalent IF category between sexes and in brain atrophy and WMH between participants with or without a family history of AD. <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC5372150-software-100">SPSS</rs> V.<rs type="version" corresp="#PMC5372150-software-100">15.0</rs> for Windows was used for all the statistical analyses.

Results for numerical values were expressed as mean &#177; standard deviation and those for categorical data were expressed as absolute frequencies and percentages. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare baseline mean differences between the groups. Repeated measure analysis was applied to determine the progress of all parameters during the entire follow-up period. Mean incase imputation method was applied to estimate the missing case parameters. MCIDs were set for 6-MWD, SGRQ score, mMRC, and BDI/TDI scores.

Chi-square tests were used to compare the frequencies of gender, employment status, marital status, family history of psychiatric disorder, subtype of bipolar disorder, polarity of initial mood episode, psychiatric and medical comorbidities, and accompanying psychotic features between the attempter and nonattempter groups. We applied Bonferroni correction over the univariate analysis of covariance and chi-squared tests for clinical characteristic variables and considered it significant when the twosided probability was less than 0.0045 (0.05/11). Finally, we performed logistic regression analysis to simultaneously identify risk factors that were significantly associated with suicide attempts.

            <p>Statistical analysis. Pearson w 2 -square test and analysis of variance were used to determine any associations between the variables. Univariate analysis was performed to test the parameters for potential survival benefit using Kaplan-Meier statistics and Log rank testing. Multivariate analysis was performed to delineate any independent variables. A Cox regression analysis with stepwise backward procedure was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs). Variables with a P value of greater than 0.05 were excluded. The concordance index (c index) was used to rank the prognostic indices in order of best discriminator of patient outcome. The Frank Harrell RMS packages were used to identify a subgroup of predictors by backward elimination. We validated the C statistic by a similar bootstrap procedure using re-sampled data, using 150 iterations <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Harrell, 2010)</ref>. A combined score was derived using logistic regression and predicted probabilities. ROC analysis was subsequently undertaken to derive a resulting C statistic. All statistical analysis was conducted using <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC3887290-software-100">SPSS</rs> statistical package <rs type="version" corresp="#PMC3887290-software-100">11.5</rs> (<rs type="publisher" corresp="#PMC3887290-software-100">SPSS Inc.</rs>, Chicago, IL, USA). <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The median age of the patients at baseline was 61 years (range 33-86). A significant proportion of patients had more than one site of metastatic disease (47%), the commonest site being the liver (45%). Almost all of the patients received at least one line of chemotherapy (93%). At the time of analysis, 56 patients had died with an overall median survival of 5.9 months (range 0.7-42.9). Four patients under active surveillance had a median follow-up time of 10.2 months (range 3.8-29.9).</p>

            <p>The aim of this study was to compare the retention of mini implant overdenture by the number, the type of magnetic attachment, and the directions of applied dislodging force. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The experimental groups were designed by the number and type of magnetic attachment. Twenty samples were tested with Magden implants. Each attachment was composed of the magnet assembly in overdenture sample and the abutment keeper in a mandibular model. Dislodging forces were applied to the overdenture samples (50.0 mm/ min) in 3 directions. The loading was repeated 10 times in each direction. The values of dislodging force were analyzed statistically using <rs type="software">SPSS</rs> at 95% level of confidence. RESULTS. The retentive force of group 2 was greater than that of group 1 in both types of attachment in every direction (P &lt; .05). Oblique retentive force of flat type magnetic attachment was higher than that of cushion type attachment in both groups (P &lt; .05). In group 1, oblique retentive force showed the highest and anterior-posterior retentive force showed the lowest value in both attachment types (P &lt; .05). In group 2, both types of attachment showed the lowest retentive force with anteriorposterior direction of dislodging force (P &lt;.05). CONCLUSION. Proper retentive properties for implant overdenture were obtained, regardless of the number and type of magnetic attachment. In both types of magnetic attachment, the greater retentive force was attained with more implants. Oblique retentive force of flat type magnetic attachment was greater than that of cushion type. Among all subgroups, anterior-posterior retentive force was the lowest among three different directions of dislodging force.</p>

            <p>Western blotting. Expression protein level of CCR-8 in lumbar spinal cord was examined by western blotting relative to b-actin. The L4-L6 segments of the lumbar spinal cord were isolated and homogenized in a lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor (Sigma); subsequently 20 mg of proteins were loaded for each lane and separated by SDS-PAGE gel (7.5%), and transferred to PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with 5% low-fat dried milk (anti-CKR8/CCR-8), 5% BSA (anti-p-NR2B, anti-NR2B) or 3% BSA (anti-p-NR1, anti-NR1) and incubated with the following for 1 h at room temperature: Rabbit monoclonal anti-CKR8/CCR-8 (1 : 500, Epitomics, Burlingame, CA, USA), antiphospho-NR1 (Ser896; 1 : 1000, Millipore), anti-NR1 (1 : 1000, Millipore), antiphospho-NMDAR2B (Y1472; 1 : 1000, R&amp;D Systems), anti-NMDAR2B (D15B3) (1 : 1000, Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-b-actin (1 : 1000, Sigma). The membrane was washed and incubated with specific secondary antibodies (Amersham ECL anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG, horseradish peroxidaselinked species-specific whole antibody, 1 : 5000, GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The blots were detected by use of ECL western blotting detection system (GE Healthcare) and LAS-4000 imaging system (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan).

            <p>One hundred seventy-fi ve EST-SSR primer pairs were synthesized (Shanghai Sangon Co. Ltd., Beijing, China). Fifty-six primer pairs were identifi ed that yielded stable, clear, and repeatable amplicons in P . sylvestris var. mongolica . The other primer pairs were unstable or gave no product. The 56 primers corresponded to 31 loci that were monomorphic (data not shown) and 25 loci that were polymorphic ( Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> ).

Here the data showed that the expression of all the four genes responded positively to exogenous glucose treatment at a time point as early as 6 h (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). The expression of the genes was induced with a steady rise after 6 h, peaked at 18 h (MYB28 and CYP79F2) or 24 h (MYB29 and CYP79F1), and then decreased sharply at 36 h. The expression levels of MYB28, MYB29, CYP79F1, and CYP79F2 increased by ~8.4-, 2.5-, 1.8-, and 1.3-fold, respectively, at 18 h after the 3% glucose treatment when compared with sorbitol treatment. So, 18 h after treatment was set as the harvest point of Arabidopsis plants for further analysis of gene expression.</p>

            <p>The initial content and format of MAPU have been described in Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. The basic schema of the database has changed dramatically, and the new database version unifies all sub-databases by reassigning the measured peptides along with their corresponding data from each experiment to protein entries of an updated database version. The new architecture is based in part on concepts developed for the Phosphorylation Site Database [PHOSIDA; www.phosida.com <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15)</ref>]. It allows the organism-specific retrieval of various cell-type and organelle associated proteomic data. The user can query the database organism-specifically by protein name, protein description, gene symbol, accession of the database used for identification [such as the International Protein Index (IPI) ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>)], SwissProt accession identifier, protein sequence or peptide sequence (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, left panel). If more than one protein entry matches with the submitted query string, MAPU 2.0 will list all relevant proteins and mark the ones identified in at least one proteomic experiment, in red (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, middle panel). Clicking on one of the red highlighted entries leads to the result page (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, right panel). If there is just a single match to the query, the web user will be guided directly to the result page describing the inquired protein. The left panel of the resulting web page displays investigated cell types and tissues. If the protein was detected in a certain sub-proteome, the corresponding button is highlighted (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, right panel). Otherwise, the image of the tissue or cell type is illustrated in light colors indicating the absence of the specified protein of interest. Clicking on one of the buttons on the left panel results in the complete listing of all peptides that have been measured in the selected cell type along with associated data such as peptide identification scores or identification scores for post-translational modifications (PTMs) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</p>

            <p>To further explore Hypothesis 2, I take advantage of a "natural experiment" derived from apportionment procedures that give certain senators and representatives identically sized and equally heterogeneous constituencies. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> Due to their small populations, some states are apportioned only one legislator to the lower house and these "representatives-at-large" are elected by the entire state. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> Since senators from these small states are elected by the same constituency, a comparison of the votes cast on the IMF by representatives-at-large and senators from the same states allows for a direct test of the argument that members of the Senate are more pro-IMF than members of the House due to their larger constituencies. If it is the size of constituencies that matters, then voting by representatives-at-large and senators from the same states should be similar, controlling for legislators' personal characteristics, <ref type="bibr">14</ref> As DW-NOMINATE is constructed solely from roll call data, it incorporates both member beliefs and the ideological positions of constituents that elect members into Congress. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fleck and Kilby (2002)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> The simulations were performed with the "Clarify" software developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Tomz et al. (1998)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> See <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Karol (2007)</ref> for an application of this experiment to trade policy voting. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> The number of states with a representative-at-large has changed over time due to population and migration shifts. For the votes in my sample, the states with a single representative include Alaska , Delaware <ref type="bibr">(1945</ref><ref type="bibr">), Hawaii (1959</ref><ref type="bibr">), Montana (1991</ref><ref type="bibr">), Nevada (1945</ref><ref type="bibr">-1978</ref><ref type="bibr">), North Dakota (1970</ref>, South <ref type="bibr">Dakota (1980</ref><ref type="bibr">Dakota ( -2009</ref>, Vermont <ref type="bibr">(1945</ref><ref type="bibr">( ), and Wyoming (1945</ref>. since they have identical constituencies. But if there is some unmodeled reason other than constituency size that accounts for why senators support the IMF more than Representatives, then voting by senators and representatives-at-large will be significantly different. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref> presents the results of this experiment. Model 6.1 is the baseline model. Model 6.2 adds REP-AT-LARGE and SENATE * REP-AT-LARGE, the interaction of the Senate dummy and the binary variable indicating whether a member is from a state with only one representative. The interaction term picks up the cases where senators and representatives have exactly the same constituencies-it is a formal test of the hypothesis that constituency size explains the Senate-House gap in support for the IMF. Notice that the SENATE point estimate is virtually identical across Models 6.1 and 6.2 while the estimate for the interaction term SENATE * REP-AT-LARGE is not significantly different than zero. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> This means we cannot reject Hypothesis 2: the Senate-House gap in support for the IMF is the same for representatives-at-large and other cases, ceteris paribus. Put another way, legislators serving in the Senate are no more pro-IMF than legislators in the House when they have identical constituencies.</p>

            <p>The infrared (IR) spectra of pure resveratrol, unloaded FNPs, and RL-FNPs were compared by Fourier transform IR (FTIR) spectroscopy. For this purpose, an FTIR spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer Spectrum 100 Series; PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), controlled with Spectrum Software version 6.1.0.0038, was used. Samples (~2 mg) were mixed with ~198 mg of KBr (Sigma-Aldrich Corp) and ground into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle, before being compressed into a disk (Perkin Elmer 15.011; PerkinElmer Inc.). Each spectrum was acquired in transmittance mode (ten scans) with a resolution of 4 cm -1 and spectral range of 4,000-500 cm -1 . The analysis was finally focused in the range of 2,000-500 cm -1 as the most informative for the IR spectra of silk fibroin for these assays.</p>

            <p>Much of this discussion has emphasized the importance of technological factors in explaining the growth of multiple authorship. Evidence for this conclusion lies not just with greater incidence of multiple authorship in quantitative journals, but with the uneven nature of the increase in multi-authored papers. The two critical periods-the mid-1960s and the period since the mid-1970s-approximately coincide with two major technical developments. The early 1960s saw the mainframe computer become established as an important tool for quantitative economic research with TSP, the first major econometrics software package, becoming available in 1967. The mid-1970s and later saw the introduction of the personal computer, with 1977 marking the launch of both the Apple II and the Commodore Pet, and 1981, the IBM PC. Since then, developments have centered around the speed and memory size of personal computers, together with an enormous growth of sophisticated software and a communications revolution.</p>

            <p>PFS was calculated from randomization to first observation of radiologically confirmed PD or death due to any cause. OS was calculated from randomization to death. Treatment response was assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.0 and evaluated at baseline and every 6 weeks. The safety profile was assessed based on AEs, laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical examinations, echocardiography, and chest X-ray. The cilengitide PK profile was determined during cycle 1. Cilengitide PK parameters were calculated according to standard non-compartmental methods using the KINETICA&#8482;, version 4.1 (or higher) software. Candidate biomarkers of response were measured in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary tumor material using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and were tested for their associations with PFS, OS, and best overall response (BOR). See supplementary Data, available at Annals of Oncology online for details of the remaining outcome measurements.</p>

            <p>Values are given as mean (standard deviation (s.d.)) when normally distributed or as median (interquartile range (IQR)) at the presence of skewed distribution. P-values of o0.05 were considered statistically significant. We used the statistical software R 2.12.2 for Windows (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).</p>
            <p>Overall survival, defined as the time from diagnosis to date of cancer-related death or date of last follow-up for patients who were alive and censored, was defined as the clinical endpoint. Overall survival probabilities were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The following predictors were selected for model development based on previous multivariable analyses <ref type="bibr">(Polterauer et al, 2011)</ref>: age (continuous variable), FIGO stage (IV vs III vs II vs IB), the presence of positive lymph nodes (positive vs negative), and at the presence of positive lymph nodes lymph node ratio (LNR; continuous variable), parametrial involvement (positive vs negative), and tumour size (p2 vs 42 cm). Lymph node ratio was defined as the ratio of positive and totally removed lymph nodes, as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Polterauer et al, 2010)</ref>. FIGO stages IA were excluded from predictive modelling, as only one event was observed in this group. The model was constructed by estimating a Cox regression model, maximising a likelihood function with a ridge (sum of squared regression coefficients) penalty term to prevent against over-fitting potentially caused by the small number of events in our study (76 events). This type of analysis can deal with data sets in which the number of events per variable is much less than 10, as it prevents overfitting by shrinking the coefficients compared with those by standard Cox regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ambler et al, 2012)</ref>. The tuning parameter that controls the amount of shrinkage of regression coefficients by the ridge penalty was optimised by maximising the average of the 10-fold cross-validated partial likelihood over 10 different random partitions of the data into 10-folds <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ambler et al, 2012)</ref>. We decided to include all preselected variables irrespective of significance as nomogram parameters as even non-significant variables must be assumed to have a non-zero effect on survival. Correlation analysis between clinical variables was performed using Spearman and Kendall tau-b rank correlation coefficients. Interactions of any predictors with FIGO stage were evaluated by comparing the cross-validated partial likelihood with and without these interactions. Likewise, we checked for non-linear effects of age or LNR by employing the technique of fractional polynomials and compared the crossvalidated partial likelihood with and without nonlinear modelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Royston and Altman, 1994)</ref>. We used the R package glmnet (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) for estimating the model coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Simon et al, 2011)</ref>.</p>
            <p>To determine calibration and discrimination of the model corrected for optimism, we generated 1000 bootstrap samples, which were used as training sets in a bootstrap validation procedure. Specifically, a model was built on each of the 1000 training sets following the same process as described above. The 1000 models were then evaluated on the original data (test set) without modification, estimating 5-year survival probabilities for each patient. For each of the validation models, we constructed a time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve using the survival ROC package of R <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Heagerty et al, 2000)</ref>. As a measure of discrimination, we computed the median and IQR over the optimism-corrected time-dependent areas under the ROC curves (the c-indices) obtained in each of the models and provide a summary c-index as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Steyerberg, 2009 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Uno et al, 2011)</ref>. The calibration of the prediction model was assessed by stratifying the patients, by their risk score, into four quartiles, and evaluating the observed 3-and 5-year survival probability in each quartile by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The mean predicted 3-and 5-year survival probabilities, averaged over the 1000 models, were compared with the averaged observed survival probabilities in calibration plots. If the model is well calibrated, this plot should demonstrate agreement of the predicted and observed survival probabilities.</p>

            <p>We then analyzed the pattern of first failures and clinical parameters influencing locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and overall survival (OS). We compared the pattern of first failures and survivals between CT-CCRT and RT-CT protocols. Comparison between the two protocols was analyzed using a chi-square test or Fisher exact test for categorical variables and the Student t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. Survival time was calculated by the interval between the date of the surgery and the date of the last follow-up or events (death event for OS, first loco-regional failure for LRFS, and first distant metastasis for DMFS). Survivals were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression model were used for www.e-roj.org http://dx.doi.org/10.3857/roj.2016.01802 univariable and multivariable analyses, respectively. Factors with a p-value of less than 0.2 by a univariable analysis were used for a multivariable analysis. Two sided p-values less than 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using R statistical packages <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. This study was reviewed and approved by the Ajou University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board (AJIRB-MED-MDB-13-036).</p>

            <p>The econometric specification is similar to that in von Gaudecker et al. ( <ref type="formula">2011</ref>) but differs in the following aspects. Their model was for discrete choices in every line of choice lists. Considering that choices within the same choice list are likely correlated, the model in this paper is specified for the stated matching probability. Therefore, the trembling hand error term is not included. The model estimation is done using the nlme package in R.</p>
